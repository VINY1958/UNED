              "' 0 0 0 1 0  The    studio    was    ﬁlled    with    the    rich    odour    of    roses,    and    when    the    light    summer    wind    stirred    amidst    the    trees    of 2 1  the    garden,    there    came    through    the    open    door    the    heavy    scent    of    the    lilac,    or    the    more    delicate    perfume    of    the 3 2  pink-flowering    thorn. 4 3  From    the    corner    of    the    divan    of    Persian    saddle-bags    on    which    he    was    lying,    smoking,    as    was    his    custom, 5 4  innumerable    cigarettes,    Lord    Henry    Wotton    could    just    catch    the    gleam    of    the    honey-sweet    and    honey-coloured 6 5  blossoms    of    a    laburnum,    whose    tremulous    branches    seemed    hardly    able    to    bear    the    burden    of    a    beauty    so 7 6  ﬂamelike    as    theirs;    and    now    and    then    the    fantastic    shadows    of    birds    in    ﬂight    ﬂitted    across    the    long    tussore-silk 8 7  curtains    that    were    stretched    in    front    of    the    huge    window,    producing    a    kind    of    momentary    Japanese    eﬀect,    and 9 8  making    him    think    of    those    pallid,    jade-faced    painters    of    Tokyo    who,    through    the    medium    of    an    art    that    is 10 9  necessarily    immobile,    seek    to    convey    the    sense    of    swiftness    and    motion.    The    sullen    murmur    of    the    bees 11 10  shouldering    their    way    through    the    long    unmown    grass,    or    circling    with    monotonous    insistence    round    the    dusty 12 11  gilt    horns    of    the    straggling    woodbine,    seemed    to    make    the    stillness    more    oppressive.    The    dim    roar    of    London 13 12  was    like    the    bourdon    note    of    a    distant    organ. 14 13  In    the    centre    of    the    room,    clamped    to    an    upright    easel,    stood    the    full-length    portrait    of    a    young    man    of 15 14  extraordinary    personal    beauty,    and    in    front    of    it,    some    little    distance    away,    was    sitting    the    artist    himself,    Basil 16 15  Hallward,    whose    sudden    disappearance    some    years    ago    caused,    at    the    time,    such    public    excitement    and    gave 17 16  rise    to    so    many    strange    conjectures. 18 17  As    the    painter    looked    at    the    gracious    and    comely    form    he    had    so    skilfully    mirrored    in    his    art,    a    smile    of 19 18  pleasure    passed    across    his    face,    and    seemed    about    to    linger    there.    But    he    suddenly    started    up,    and    closing    his 20 19  eyes,    placed    his    ﬁngers    upon    the    lids,    as    though    he    sought    to    imprison    within    his    brain    some    curious    dream 21 20  from    which    he    feared    he    might    awake. 22 21  “It    is    your    best    work,    Basil,    the    best    thing    you    have    ever    done,”    said    Lord    Henry    languidly.    “You    must    certainly 23 22  send    it    next    year    to    the    Grosvenor.    The    Academy    is    too    large    and    too    vulgar.    Whenever    I    have    gone    there, 24 23  there    have    been    either    so    many    people    that    I    have    not    been    able    to    see    the    pictures,    which    was    dreadful,    or    so 25 24  many    pictures    that    I    have    not    been    able    to    see    the    people,    which    was    worse.    The    Grosvenor    is    really    the    only 26 25  place.” 27 26  “I    don’t    think    I    shall    send    it    anywhere,”    he    answered,    tossing    his    head    back    in    that    odd    way    that    used    to    make 28 27  his    friends    laugh    at    him    at    Oxford.    “No,    I    won’t    send    it    anywhere.” 29 28  Lord    Henry    elevated    his    eyebrows    and    looked    at    him    in    amazement    through    the    thin    blue    wreaths    of    smoke 30 29  that    curled    up    in    such    fanciful    whorls    from    his    heavy,    opium-tainted    cigarette.    “Not    send    it    anywhere?    My    dear 31 30  fellow,    why?    Have    you    any    reason?    What    odd    chaps    you    painters    are!    You    do    anything    in    the    world    to    gain    a 32 31  reputation.    As    soon    as    you    have    one,    you    seem    to    want    to    throw    it    away.    It    is    silly    of    you,    for    there    is    only    one 33 32  thing    in    the    world    worse    than    being    talked    about,    and    that    is    not    being    talked    about.    A    portrait    like    this    would    set 34 33  you    far    above    all    the    young    men    in    England,    and    make    the    old    men    quite    jealous,    if    old    men    are    ever    capable    of 35 34  any    emotion.” 36 35  “I    know    you    will    laugh    at    me,”    he    replied,    “but    I    really    can’t    exhibit    it.    I    have    put    too    much    of    myself    into    it.” 37 36  Lord    Henry    stretched    himself    out    on    the    divan    and    laughed. 38 37  “Yes,    I    knew    you    would;    but    it    is    quite    true,    all    the    same.” 39 38  “Too    much    of    yourself    in    it!    Upon    my    word,    Basil,    I    didn’t    know    you    were    so    vain;    and    I    really    can’t    see    any 40 39  resemblance    between    you,    with    your    rugged    strong    face    and    your    coal-black    hair,    and    this    young    Adonis,    who 41 40  looks    as    if    he    was    made    out    of    ivory    and    rose-leaves.    Why,    my    dear    Basil,    he    is    a    Narcissus,    and    you—well,    of 42 41  course    you    have    an    intellectual    expression    and    all    that.    But    beauty,    real    beauty,    ends    where    an    intellectual 43 42  expression    begins.    Intellect    is    in    itself    a    mode    of    exaggeration,    and    destroys    the    harmony    of    any    face.    The 44 43  moment    one    sits    down    to    think,    one    becomes    all    nose,    or    all    forehead,    or    something    horrid.    Look    at    the 45 44  successful    men    in    any    of    the    learned    professions.    How    perfectly    hideous    they    are!    Except,    of    course,    in    the 46 45  Church.    But    then    in    the    Church    they    don’t    think.    A    bishop    keeps    on    saying    at    the    age    of    eighty    what    he    was    told 47 46  to    say    when    he    was    a    boy    of    eighteen,    and    as    a    natural    consequence    he    always    looks    absolutely    delightful.    Your 48 47  mysterious    young    friend,    whose    name    you    have    never    told    me,    but    whose    picture    really    fascinates    me,    never 49 48  thinks.    I    feel    quite    sure    of    that.    He    is    some    brainless    beautiful    creature    who    should    be    always    here    in    winter 50 49  when    we    have    no    ﬂowers    to    look    at,    and    always    here    in    summer    when    we    want    something    to    chill    our 51 50  intelligence.    Don’t    flatter    yourself,    Basil:    you    are    not    in    the    least    like    him.” 52 51  “You    don’t    understand    me,    Harry,”    answered    the    artist.    “Of    course    I    am    not    like    him.    I    know    that    perfectly    well. 53 52  Indeed,    I    should    be    sorry    to    look    like    him.    You    shrug    your    shoulders?    I    am    telling    you    the    truth.    There    is    a    fatality 54 53  about    all    physical    and    intellectual    distinction,    the    sort    of    fatality    that    seems    to    dog    through    history    the    faltering 55 54  steps    of    kings.    It    is    better    not    to    be    diﬀerent    from    one’s    fellows.    The    ugly    and    the    stupid    have    the    best    of    it    in    this 56 55  world.    They    can    sit    at    their    ease    and    gape    at    the    play.    If    they    know    nothing    of    victory,    they    are    at    least    spared 57 56  the    knowledge    of    defeat.    They    live    as    we    all    should    live—undisturbed,    indiﬀerent,    and    without    disquiet.    They 58 57  neither    bring    ruin    upon    others,    nor    ever    receive    it    from    alien    hands.    Your    rank    and    wealth,    Harry;    my    brains, 59 58  such    as    they    are—my    art,    whatever    it    may    be    worth;    Dorian    Gray’s    good    looks—we    shall    all    suﬀer    for    what    the 60 59  gods    have    given    us,    suffer    terribly.” 61 60  “Dorian    Gray?    Is    that    his    name?”    asked    Lord    Henry,    walking    across    the    studio    towards    Basil    Hallward. 62 61  “Yes,    that    is    his    name.    I    didn’t    intend    to    tell    it    to    you.” 63 62  “But    why    not?” 64 63  “Oh,    I    can’t    explain.    When    I    like    people    immensely,    I    never    tell    their    names    to    any    one.    It    is    like    surrendering    a 65 64  part    of    them.    I    have    grown    to    love    secrecy.    It    seems    to    be    the    one    thing    that    can    make    modern    life    mysterious 66 65  or    marvellous    to    us.    The    commonest    thing    is    delightful    if    one    only    hides    it.    When    I    leave    town    now    I    never    tell    my 67 66  people    where    I    am    going.    If    I    did,    I    would    lose    all    my    pleasure.    It    is    a    silly    habit,    I    dare    say,    but    somehow    it 68 67  \\x0cseems    to    bring    a    great    deal    of    romance    into    one’s    life.    I    suppose    you    think    me    awfully    foolish    about    it?” 69 68  “Not    at    all,”    answered    Lord    Henry,    “not    at    all,    my    dear    Basil.    You    seem    to    forget    that    I    am    married,    and    the 70 69  one    charm    of    marriage    is    that    it    makes    a    life    of    deception    absolutely    necessary    for    both    parties.    I    never    know 71 70  where    my    wife    is,    and    my    wife    never    knows    what    I    am    doing.    When    we    meet—we    do    meet    occasionally,    when 72 71  we    dine    out    together,    or    go    down    to    the    Duke’s—we    tell    each    other    the    most    absurd    stories    with    the    most 73 72  serious    faces.    My    wife    is    very    good    at    it—much    better,    in    fact,    than    I    am.    She    never    gets    confused    over    her 74 73  dates,    and    I    always    do.    But    when    she    does    ﬁnd    me    out,    she    makes    no    row    at    all.    I    sometimes    wish    she    would; 75 74  but    she    merely    laughs    at    me.” 76 75  “I    hate    the    way    you    talk    about    your    married    life,    Harry,”    said    Basil    Hallward,    strolling    towards    the    door    that    led 77 76  into    the    garden.    “I    believe    that    you    are    really    a    very    good    husband,    but    that    you    are    thoroughly    ashamed    of    your 78 77  own    virtues.    You    are    an    extraordinary    fellow.    You    never    say    a    moral    thing,    and    you    never    do    a    wrong    thing.    Your 79 78  cynicism    is    simply    a    pose.” 80 79  “Being    natural    is    simply    a    pose,    and    the    most    irritating    pose    I    know,”    cried    Lord    Henry,    laughing;    and    the    two 81 80  young    men    went    out    into    the    garden    together    and    ensconced    themselves    on    a    long    bamboo    seat    that    stood    in 82 81  the    shade    of    a    tall    laurel    bush.    The    sunlight    slipped    over    the    polished    leaves.    In    the    grass,    white    daisies    were 83 82  tremulous. 84 83  After    a    pause,    Lord    Henry    pulled    out    his    watch.    “I    am    afraid    I    must    be    going,    Basil,”    he    murmured,    “and    before 85 84  I    go,    I    insist    on    your    answering    a    question    I    put    to    you    some    time    ago.” 86 85  “What    is    that?”    said    the    painter,    keeping    his    eyes    fixed    on    the    ground. 87 86  “You    know    quite    well.” 88 87  “I    do    not,    Harry.” 89 88  “Well,    I    will    tell    you    what    it    is.    I    want    you    to    explain    to    me    why    you    won’t    exhibit    Dorian    Gray’s    picture.    I    want 90 89  the    real    reason.” 91 90  “I    told    you    the    real    reason.” 92 91  “No,    you    did    not.    You    said    it    was    because    there    was    too    much    of    yourself    in    it.    Now,    that    is    childish.” 93 92  “Harry,”    said    Basil    Hallward,    looking    him    straight    in    the    face,    “every    portrait    that    is    painted    with    feeling    is    a 94 93  portrait    of    the    artist,    not    of    the    sitter.    The    sitter    is    merely    the    accident,    the    occasion.    It    is    not    he    who    is    revealed 95 94  by    the    painter;    it    is    rather    the    painter    who,    on    the    coloured    canvas,    reveals    himself.    The    reason    I    will    not    exhibit 96 95  this    picture    is    that    I    am    afraid    that    I    have    shown    in    it    the    secret    of    my    own    soul.” 97 96  Lord    Henry    laughed.    “And    what    is    that?”    he    asked. 98 97  “I    will    tell    you,”    said    Hallward;    but    an    expression    of    perplexity    came    over    his    face. 99 98  “I    am    all    expectation,    Basil,”    continued    his    companion,    glancing    at    him. 100 99  “Oh,    there    is    really    very    little    to    tell,    Harry,”    answered    the    painter;    “and    I    am    afraid    you    will    hardly    understand 101 100  it.    Perhaps    you    will    hardly    believe    it.” 102 101  Lord    Henry    smiled,    and    leaning    down,    plucked    a    pink-petalled    daisy    from    the    grass    and    examined    it.    “I    am 103 102  quite    sure    I    shall    understand    it,”    he    replied,    gazing    intently    at    the    little    golden,    white-feathered    disk,    “and    as    for 104 103  believing    things,    I    can    believe    anything,    provided    that    it    is    quite    incredible.” 105 104  The    wind    shook    some    blossoms    from    the    trees,    and    the    heavy    lilac-blooms,    with    their    clustering    stars,    moved 106 105  to    and    fro    in    the    languid    air.    A    grasshopper    began    to    chirrup    by    the    wall,    and    like    a    blue    thread    a    long    thin 107 106  dragon-ﬂy    ﬂoated    past    on    its    brown    gauze    wings.    Lord    Henry    felt    as    if    he    could    hear    Basil    Hallward’s    heart 108 107  beating,    and    wondered    what    was    coming. 109 108  “The    story    is    simply    this,”    said    the    painter    after    some    time.    “Two    months    ago    I    went    to    a    crush    at    Lady 110 109  Brandon’s.    You    know    we    poor    artists    have    to    show    ourselves    in    society    from    time    to    time,    just    to    remind    the 111 110  public    that    we    are    not    savages.    With    an    evening    coat    and    a    white    tie,    as    you    told    me    once,    anybody,    even    a 112 111  stock-broker,    can    gain    a    reputation    for    being    civilized.    Well,    after    I    had    been    in    the    room    about    ten    minutes, 113 112  talking    to    huge    overdressed    dowagers    and    tedious    academicians,    I    suddenly    became    conscious    that    some    one 114 113  was    looking    at    me.    I    turned    half-way    round    and    saw    Dorian    Gray    for    the    ﬁrst    time.    When    our    eyes    met,    I    felt    that 115 114  I    was    growing    pale.    A    curious    sensation    of    terror    came    over    me.    I    knew    that    I    had    come    face    to    face    with    some 116 115  one    whose    mere    personality    was    so    fascinating    that,    if    I    allowed    it    to    do    so,    it    would    absorb    my    whole    nature,    my 117 116  whole    soul,    my    very    art    itself.    I    did    not    want    any    external    inﬂuence    in    my    life.    You    know    yourself,    Harry,    how 118 117  independent    I    am    by    nature.    I    have    always    been    my    own    master;    had    at    least    always    been    so,    till    I    met    Dorian 119 118  Gray.    Then—but    I    don’t    know    how    to    explain    it    to    you.    Something    seemed    to    tell    me    that    I    was    on    the    verge    of    a 120 119  terrible    crisis    in    my    life.    I    had    a    strange    feeling    that    fate    had    in    store    for    me    exquisite    joys    and    exquisite    sorrows. 121 120  I    grew    afraid    and    turned    to    quit    the    room.    It    was    not    conscience    that    made    me    do    so:    it    was    a    sort    of    cowardice.    I 122 121  take    no    credit    to    myself    for    trying    to    escape.” 123 122  “Conscience    and    cowardice    are    really    the    same    things,    Basil.    Conscience    is    the    trade-name    of    the    ﬁrm.    That 124 123  is    all.” 125 124  “I    don’t    believe    that,    Harry,    and    I    don’t    believe    you    do    either.    However,    whatever    was    my    motive—and    it    may 126 125  have    been    pride,    for    I    used    to    be    very    proud—I    certainly    struggled    to    the    door.    There,    of    course,    I    stumbled 127 126  against    Lady    Brandon.    ‘You    are    not    going    to    run    away    so    soon,    Mr.    Hallward?’    she    screamed    out.    You    know 128 127  her    curiously    shrill    voice?” 129 128  “Yes;    she    is    a    peacock    in    everything    but    beauty,”    said    Lord    Henry,    pulling    the    daisy    to    bits    with    his    long 130 129  nervous    fingers. 131 130  “I    could    not    get    rid    of    her.    She    brought    me    up    to    royalties,    and    people    with    stars    and    garters,    and    elderly 132 131  ladies    with    gigantic    tiaras    and    parrot    noses.    She    spoke    of    me    as    her    dearest    friend.    I    had    only    met    her    once 133 132  before,    but    she    took    it    into    her    head    to    lionize    me.    I    believe    some    picture    of    mine    had    made    a    great    success    at 134 133  the    time,    at    least    had    been    chattered    about    in    the    penny    newspapers,    which    is    the    nineteenth-century    standard 135 134  of    immortality.    Suddenly    I    found    myself    face    to    face    with    the    young    man    whose    personality    had    so    strangely 136 135  stirred    me.    We    were    quite    close,    almost    touching.    Our    eyes    met    again.    It    was    reckless    of    me,    but    I    asked    Lady 137 136  \\x0cBrandon    to    introduce    me    to    him.    Perhaps    it    was    not    so    reckless,    after    all.    It    was    simply    inevitable.    We    would 138 137  have    spoken    to    each    other    without    any    introduction.    I    am    sure    of    that.    Dorian    told    me    so    afterwards.    He,    too,    felt 139 138  that    we    were    destined    to    know    each    other.” 140 139  “And    how    did    Lady    Brandon    describe    this    wonderful    young    man?”    asked    his    companion.    “I    know    she    goes    in 141 140  for    giving    a    rapid    précis    of    all    her    guests.    I    remember    her    bringing    me    up    to    a    truculent    and    red-faced    old 142 141  gentleman    covered    all    over    with    orders    and    ribbons,    and    hissing    into    my    ear,    in    a    tragic    whisper    which    must 143 142  have    been    perfectly    audible    to    everybody    in    the    room,    the    most    astounding    details.    I    simply    ﬂed.    I    like    to    ﬁnd    out 144 143  people    for    myself.    But    Lady    Brandon    treats    her    guests    exactly    as    an    auctioneer    treats    his    goods.    She    either 145 144  explains    them    entirely    away,    or    tells    one    everything    about    them    except    what    one    wants    to    know.” 146 145  “Poor    Lady    Brandon!    You    are    hard    on    her,    Harry!”    said    Hallward    listlessly. 147 146  “My    dear    fellow,    she    tried    to    found    a    salon,    and    only    succeeded    in    opening    a    restaurant.    How    could    I    admire 148 147  her?    But    tell    me,    what    did    she    say    about    Mr.    Dorian    Gray?” 149 148  “Oh,    something    like,    ‘Charming    boy—poor    dear    mother    and    I    absolutely    inseparable.    Quite    forget    what    he 150 149  does—afraid    he—doesn’t    do    anything—oh,    yes,    plays    the    piano—or    is    it    the    violin,    dear    Mr.    Gray?’    Neither    of 151 150  us    could    help    laughing,    and    we    became    friends    at    once.” 152 151  “Laughter    is    not    at    all    a    bad    beginning    for    a    friendship,    and    it    is    far    the    best    ending    for    one,”    said    the    young 153 152  lord,    plucking    another    daisy. 154 153  Hallward    shook    his    head.    “You    don’t    understand    what    friendship    is,    Harry,”    he    murmured—“or    what    enmity    is, 155 154  for    that    matter.    You    like    every    one;    that    is    to    say,    you    are    indifferent    to    every    one.” 156 155  “How    horribly    unjust    of    you!”    cried    Lord    Henry,    tilting    his    hat    back    and    looking    up    at    the    little    clouds    that,    like 157 156  ravelled    skeins    of    glossy    white    silk,    were    drifting    across    the    hollowed    turquoise    of    the    summer    sky.    “Yes; 158 157  horribly    unjust    of    you.    I    make    a    great    diﬀerence    between    people.    I    choose    my    friends    for    their    good    looks,    my 159 158  acquaintances    for    their    good    characters,    and    my    enemies    for    their    good    intellects.    A    man    cannot    be    too    careful 160 159  in    the    choice    of    his    enemies.    I    have    not    got    one    who    is    a    fool.    They    are    all    men    of    some    intellectual    power,    and 161 160  consequently    they    all    appreciate    me.    Is    that    very    vain    of    me?    I    think    it    is    rather    vain.” 162 161  “I    should    think    it    was,    Harry.    But    according    to    your    category    I    must    be    merely    an    acquaintance.” 163 162  “My    dear    old    Basil,    you    are    much    more    than    an    acquaintance.” 164 163  “And    much    less    than    a    friend.    A    sort    of    brother,    I    suppose?” 165 164  “Oh,    brothers!    I    don’t    care    for    brothers.    My    elder    brother    won’t    die,    and    my    younger    brothers    seem    never    to    do 166 165  anything    else.” 167 166  “Harry!”    exclaimed    Hallward,    frowning. 168 167  “My    dear    fellow,    I    am    not    quite    serious.    But    I    can’t    help    detesting    my    relations.    I    suppose    it    comes    from    the 169 168  fact    that    none    of    us    can    stand    other    people    having    the    same    faults    as    ourselves.    I    quite    sympathize    with    the 170 169  rage    of    the    English    democracy    against    what    they    call    the    vices    of    the    upper    orders.    The    masses    feel    that 171 170  drunkenness,    stupidity,    and    immorality    should    be    their    own    special    property,    and    that    if    any    one    of    us    makes    an 172 171  ass    of    himself,    he    is    poaching    on    their    preserves.    When    poor    Southwark    got    into    the    divorce    court,    their 173 172  indignation    was    quite    magnificent.    And    yet    I    don’t    suppose    that    ten    per    cent    of    the    proletariat    live    correctly.” 174 173  “I    don’t    agree    with    a    single    word    that    you    have    said,    and,    what    is    more,    Harry,    I    feel    sure    you    don’t    either.” 175 174  Lord    Henry    stroked    his    pointed    brown    beard    and    tapped    the    toe    of    his    patent-leather    boot    with    a    tasselled 176 175  ebony    cane.    “How    English    you    are    Basil!    That    is    the    second    time    you    have    made    that    observation.    If    one    puts 177 176  forward    an    idea    to    a    true    Englishman—always    a    rash    thing    to    do—he    never    dreams    of    considering    whether    the 178 177  idea    is    right    or    wrong.    The    only    thing    he    considers    of    any    importance    is    whether    one    believes    it    oneself.    Now, 179 178  the    value    of    an    idea    has    nothing    whatsoever    to    do    with    the    sincerity    of    the    man    who    expresses    it.    Indeed,    the 180 179  probabilities    are    that    the    more    insincere    the    man    is,    the    more    purely    intellectual    will    the    idea    be,    as    in    that    case 181 180  it    will    not    be    coloured    by    either    his    wants,    his    desires,    or    his    prejudices.    However,    I    don’t    propose    to    discuss 182 181  politics,    sociology,    or    metaphysics    with    you.    I    like    persons    better    than    principles,    and    I    like    persons    with    no 183 182  principles    better    than    anything    else    in    the    world.    Tell    me    more    about    Mr.    Dorian    Gray.    How    often    do    you    see 184 183  him?” 185 184  “Every    day.    I    couldn’t    be    happy    if    I    didn’t    see    him    every    day.    He    is    absolutely    necessary    to    me.” 186 185  “How    extraordinary!    I    thought    you    would    never    care    for    anything    but    your    art.” 187 186  “He    is    all    my    art    to    me    now,”    said    the    painter    gravely.    “I    sometimes    think,    Harry,    that    there    are    only    two    eras 188 187  of    any    importance    in    the    world’s    history.    The    ﬁrst    is    the    appearance    of    a    new    medium    for    art,    and    the    second    is 189 188  the    appearance    of    a    new    personality    for    art    also.    What    the    invention    of    oil-painting    was    to    the    Venetians,    the 190 189  face    of    Antinous    was    to    late    Greek    sculpture,    and    the    face    of    Dorian    Gray    will    some    day    be    to    me.    It    is    not 191 190  merely    that    I    paint    from    him,    draw    from    him,    sketch    from    him.    Of    course,    I    have    done    all    that.    But    he    is    much 192 191  more    to    me    than    a    model    or    a    sitter.    I    won’t    tell    you    that    I    am    dissatisﬁed    with    what    I    have    done    of    him,    or    that 193 192  his    beauty    is    such    that    art    cannot    express    it.    There    is    nothing    that    art    cannot    express,    and    I    know    that    the    work    I 194 193  have    done,    since    I    met    Dorian    Gray,    is    good    work,    is    the    best    work    of    my    life.    But    in    some    curious    way—I 195 194  wonder    will    you    understand    me?—his    personality    has    suggested    to    me    an    entirely    new    manner    in    art,    an 196 195  entirely    new    mode    of    style.    I    see    things    diﬀerently,    I    think    of    them    diﬀerently.    I    can    now    recreate    life    in    a    way    that 197 196  was    hidden    from    me    before.    ‘A    dream    of    form    in    days    of    thought’—who    is    it    who    says    that?    I    forget;    but    it    is    what 198 197  Dorian    Gray    has    been    to    me.    The    merely    visible    presence    of    this    lad—for    he    seems    to    me    little    more    than    a    lad, 199 198  though    he    is    really    over    twenty—his    merely    visible    presence—ah!    I    wonder    can    you    realize    all    that    that    means? 200 199  Unconsciously    he    deﬁnes    for    me    the    lines    of    a    fresh    school,    a    school    that    is    to    have    in    it    all    the    passion    of    the 201 200  romantic    spirit,    all    the    perfection    of    the    spirit    that    is    Greek.    The    harmony    of    soul    and    body—how    much    that    is! 202 201  We    in    our    madness    have    separated    the    two,    and    have    invented    a    realism    that    is    vulgar,    an    ideality    that    is    void. 203 202  Harry!    if    you    only    knew    what    Dorian    Gray    is    to    me!    You    remember    that    landscape    of    mine,    for    which    Agnew 204 203  oﬀered    me    such    a    huge    price    but    which    I    would    not    part    with?    It    is    one    of    the    best    things    I    have    ever    done.    And 205 204  why    is    it    so?    Because,    while    I    was    painting    it,    Dorian    Gray    sat    beside    me.    Some    subtle    inﬂuence    passed    from 206 205  him    to    me,    and    for    the    ﬁrst    time    in    my    life    I    saw    in    the    plain    woodland    the    wonder    I    had    always    looked    for    and 207 206  \\x0calways    missed.” 208 207  “Basil,    this    is    extraordinary!    I    must    see    Dorian    Gray.” 209 208  Hallward    got    up    from    the    seat    and    walked    up    and    down    the    garden.    After    some    time    he    came    back.    “Harry,” 210 209  he    said,    “Dorian    Gray    is    to    me    simply    a    motive    in    art.    You    might    see    nothing    in    him.    I    see    everything    in    him.    He 211 210  is    never    more    present    in    my    work    than    when    no    image    of    him    is    there.    He    is    a    suggestion,    as    I    have    said,    of    a 212 211  new    manner.    I    ﬁnd    him    in    the    curves    of    certain    lines,    in    the    loveliness    and    subtleties    of    certain    colours.    That    is 213 212  all.” 214 213  “Then    why    won’t    you    exhibit    his    portrait?”    asked    Lord    Henry. 215 214  “Because,    without    intending    it,    I    have    put    into    it    some    expression    of    all    this    curious    artistic    idolatry,    of    which,    o 216 215  course,    I    have    never    cared    to    speak    to    him.    He    knows    nothing    about    it.    He    shall    never    know    anything    about    it. 217 216  But    the    world    might    guess    it,    and    I    will    not    bare    my    soul    to    their    shallow    prying    eyes.    My    heart    shall    never    be    put 218 217  under    their    microscope.    There    is    too    much    of    myself    in    the    thing,    Harry—too    much    of    myself!” 219 218  “Poets    are    not    so    scrupulous    as    you    are.    They    know    how    useful    passion    is    for    publication.    Nowadays    a 220 219  broken    heart    will    run    to    many    editions.” 221 220  “I    hate    them    for    it,”    cried    Hallward.    “An    artist    should    create    beautiful    things,    but    should    put    nothing    of    his    own 222 221  life    into    them.    We    live    in    an    age    when    men    treat    art    as    if    it    were    meant    to    be    a    form    of    autobiography.    We    have 223 222  lost    the    abstract    sense    of    beauty.    Some    day    I    will    show    the    world    what    it    is;    and    for    that    reason    the    world    shall 224 223  never    see    my    portrait    of    Dorian    Gray.” 225 224  “I    think    you    are    wrong,    Basil,    but    I    won’t    argue    with    you.    It    is    only    the    intellectually    lost    who    ever    argue.    Tell 226 225  me,    is    Dorian    Gray    very    fond    of    you?” 227 226  The    painter    considered    for    a    few    moments.    “He    likes    me,”    he    answered    after    a    pause;    “I    know    he    likes    me.    Of 228 227  course    I    ﬂatter    him    dreadfully.    I    ﬁnd    a    strange    pleasure    in    saying    things    to    him    that    I    know    I    shall    be    sorry    for 229 228  having    said.    As    a    rule,    he    is    charming    to    me,    and    we    sit    in    the    studio    and    talk    of    a    thousand    things.    Now    and 230 229  then,    however,    he    is    horribly    thoughtless,    and    seems    to    take    a    real    delight    in    giving    me    pain.    Then    I    feel,    Harry, 231 230  that    I    have    given    away    my    whole    soul    to    some    one    who    treats    it    as    if    it    were    a    ﬂower    to    put    in    his    coat,    a    bit    of 232 231  decoration    to    charm    his    vanity,    an    ornament    for    a    summer’s    day.” 233 232  “Days    in    summer,    Basil,    are    apt    to    linger,”    murmured    Lord    Henry.    “Perhaps    you    will    tire    sooner    than    he    will.    It 234 233  is    a    sad    thing    to    think    of,    but    there    is    no    doubt    that    genius    lasts    longer    than    beauty.    That    accounts    for    the    fact 235 234  that    we    all    take    such    pains    to    over-educate    ourselves.    In    the    wild    struggle    for    existence,    we    want    to    have 236 235  something    that    endures,    and    so    we    ﬁll    our    minds    with    rubbish    and    facts,    in    the    silly    hope    of    keeping    our    place. 237 236  The    thoroughly    well-informed    man—that    is    the    modern    ideal.    And    the    mind    of    the    thoroughly    well-informed    man 238 237  is    a    dreadful    thing.    It    is    like    a    bric-à-brac    shop,    all    monsters    and    dust,    with    everything    priced    above    its    proper 239 238  value.    I    think    you    will    tire    ﬁrst,    all    the    same.    Some    day    you    will    look    at    your    friend,    and    he    will    seem    to    you    to    be 240 239  a    little    out    of    drawing,    or    you    won’t    like    his    tone    of    colour,    or    something.    You    will    bitterly    reproach    him    in    your 241 240  own    heart,    and    seriously    think    that    he    has    behaved    very    badly    to    you.    The    next    time    he    calls,    you    will    be 242 241  perfectly    cold    and    indiﬀerent.    It    will    be    a    great    pity,    for    it    will    alter    you.    What    you    have    told    me    is    quite    a 243 242  romance,    a    romance    of    art    one    might    call    it,    and    the    worst    of    having    a    romance    of    any    kind    is    that    it    leaves    one 244 243  so    unromantic.” 245 244  “Harry,    don’t    talk    like    that.    As    long    as    I    live,    the    personality    of    Dorian    Gray    will    dominate    me.    You    can’t    feel 246 245  what    I    feel.    You    change    too    often.” 247 246  “Ah,    my    dear    Basil,    that    is    exactly    why    I    can    feel    it.    Those    who    are    faithful    know    only    the    trivial    side    of    love:    it 248 247  is    the    faithless    who    know    love’s    tragedies.”    And    Lord    Henry    struck    a    light    on    a    dainty    silver    case    and    began    to 249 248  smoke    a    cigarette    with    a    self-conscious    and    satisﬁed    air,    as    if    he    had    summed    up    the    world    in    a    phrase.    There 250 249  was    a    rustle    of    chirruping    sparrows    in    the    green    lacquer    leaves    of    the    ivy,    and    the    blue    cloud-shadows    chased 251 250  themselves    across    the    grass    like    swallows.    How    pleasant    it    was    in    the    garden!    And    how    delightful    other 252 251  people’s    emotions    were!—much    more    delightful    than    their    ideas,    it    seemed    to    him.    One’s    own    soul,    and    the 253 252  passions    of    one’s    friends—those    were    the    fascinating    things    in    life.    He    pictured    to    himself    with    silent    amusement 254 253  the    tedious    luncheon    that    he    had    missed    by    staying    so    long    with    Basil    Hallward.    Had    he    gone    to    his    aunt’s,    he 255 254  would    have    been    sure    to    have    met    Lord    Goodbody    there,    and    the    whole    conversation    would    have    been    about 256 255  the    feeding    of    the    poor    and    the    necessity    for    model    lodging-houses.    Each    class    would    have    preached    the 257 256  importance    of    those    virtues,    for    whose    exercise    there    was    no    necessity    in    their    own    lives.    The    rich    would    have 258 257  spoken    on    the    value    of    thrift,    and    the    idle    grown    eloquent    over    the    dignity    of    labour.    It    was    charming    to    have 259 258  escaped    all    that!    As    he    thought    of    his    aunt,    an    idea    seemed    to    strike    him.    He    turned    to    Hallward    and    said,    “My 260 259  dear    fellow,    I    have    just    remembered.” 261 260  “Remembered    what,    Harry?” 262 261  “Where    I    heard    the    name    of    Dorian    Gray.” 263 262  “Where    was    it?”    asked    Hallward,    with    a    slight    frown. 264 263  “Don’t    look    so    angry,    Basil.    It    was    at    my    aunt,    Lady    Agatha’s.    She    told    me    she    had    discovered    a    wonderful 265 264  young    man    who    was    going    to    help    her    in    the    East    End,    and    that    his    name    was    Dorian    Gray.    I    am    bound    to    state 266 265  that    she    never    told    me    he    was    good-looking.    Women    have    no    appreciation    of    good    looks;    at    least,    good    women 267 266  have    not.    She    said    that    he    was    very    earnest    and    had    a    beautiful    nature.    I    at    once    pictured    to    myself    a    creature 268 267  with    spectacles    and    lank    hair,    horribly    freckled,    and    tramping    about    on    huge    feet.    I    wish    I    had    known    it    was    your 269 268  friend.” 270 269  “I    am    very    glad    you    didn’t,    Harry.” 271 270  “Why?” 272 271  “I    don’t    want    you    to    meet    him.” 273 272  “You    don’t    want    me    to    meet    him?” 274 273  “No.” 275 274  “Mr.    Dorian    Gray    is    in    the    studio,    sir,”    said    the    butler,    coming    into    the    garden. 276 275  \\x0c                “You    must    introduce    me    now,”    cried    Lord    Henry,    laughing. 277 276  The    painter    turned    to    his    servant,    who    stood    blinking    in    the    sunlight.    “Ask    Mr.    Gray    to    wait,    Parker:    I    shall    be 278 277  in    in    a    few    moments.”    The    man    bowed    and    went    up    the    walk. 279 278  Then    he    looked    at    Lord    Henry.    “Dorian    Gray    is    my    dearest    friend,”    he    said.    “He    has    a    simple    and    a    beautiful 280 279  nature.    Your    aunt    was    quite    right    in    what    she    said    of    him.    Don’t    spoil    him.    Don’t    try    to    inﬂuence    him.    Your 281 280  inﬂuence    would    be    bad.    The    world    is    wide,    and    has    many    marvellous    people    in    it.    Don’t    take    away    from    me    the 282 281  one    person    who    gives    to    my    art    whatever    charm    it    possesses:    my    life    as    an    artist    depends    on    him.    Mind,    Harry, 283 282  I    trust    you.”    He    spoke    very    slowly,    and    the    words    seemed    wrung    out    of    him    almost    against    his    will. 284 283  “What    nonsense    you    talk!”    said    Lord    Henry,    smiling,    and    taking    Hallward    by    the    arm,    he    almost    led    him    into 285 284  the    house. 286 285  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                                        CHAPTER    II. 287 286  As    they    entered    they    saw    Dorian    Gray.    He    was    seated    at    the    piano,    with    his    back    to    them,    turning    over    the 288 287  pages    of    a    volume    of    Schumann’s    “Forest    Scenes.”    “You    must    lend    me    these,    Basil,”    he    cried.    “I    want    to    learn 289 288  them.    They    are    perfectly    charming.” 290 289  “That    entirely    depends    on    how    you    sit    to-day,    Dorian.” 291 290  “Oh,    I    am    tired    of    sitting,    and    I    don’t    want    a    life-sized    portrait    of    myself,”    answered    the    lad,    swinging    round    on 292 291  the    music-stool    in    a    wilful,    petulant    manner.    When    he    caught    sight    of    Lord    Henry,    a    faint    blush    coloured    his 293 292  cheeks    for    a    moment,    and    he    started    up.    “I    beg    your    pardon,    Basil,    but    I    didn’t    know    you    had    any    one    with    you.” 294 293  “This    is    Lord    Henry    Wotton,    Dorian,    an    old    Oxford    friend    of    mine.    I    have    just    been    telling    him    what    a    capital 295 294  sitter    you    were,    and    now    you    have    spoiled    everything.” 296 295  “You    have    not    spoiled    my    pleasure    in    meeting    you,    Mr.    Gray,”    said    Lord    Henry,    stepping    forward    and 297 296  extending    his    hand.    “My    aunt    has    often    spoken    to    me    about    you.    You    are    one    of    her    favourites,    and,    I    am    afraid, 298 297  one    of    her    victims    also.” 299 298  “I    am    in    Lady    Agatha’s    black    books    at    present,”    answered    Dorian    with    a    funny    look    of    penitence.    “I    promised 300 299  to    go    to    a    club    in    Whitechapel    with    her    last    Tuesday,    and    I    really    forgot    all    about    it.    We    were    to    have    played    a 301 300  duet    together—three    duets,    I    believe.    I    don’t    know    what    she    will    say    to    me.    I    am    far    too    frightened    to    call.” 302 301  “Oh,    I    will    make    your    peace    with    my    aunt.    She    is    quite    devoted    to    you.    And    I    don’t    think    it    really    matters    about 303 302  your    not    being    there.    The    audience    probably    thought    it    was    a    duet.    When    Aunt    Agatha    sits    down    to    the    piano, 304 303  she    makes    quite    enough    noise    for    two    people.” 305 304  “That    is    very    horrid    to    her,    and    not    very    nice    to    me,”    answered    Dorian,    laughing. 306 305  Lord    Henry    looked    at    him.    Yes,    he    was    certainly    wonderfully    handsome,    with    his    ﬁnely    curved    scarlet    lips,    his 307 306  frank    blue    eyes,    his    crisp    gold    hair.    There    was    something    in    his    face    that    made    one    trust    him    at    once.    All    the 308 307  candour    of    youth    was    there,    as    well    as    all    youth’s    passionate    purity.    One    felt    that    he    had    kept    himself    unspotted 309 308  from    the    world.    No    wonder    Basil    Hallward    worshipped    him. 310 309  “You    are    too    charming    to    go    in    for    philanthropy,    Mr.    Gray—far    too    charming.”    And    Lord    Henry    ﬂung    himself 311 310  down    on    the    divan    and    opened    his    cigarette-case. 312 311  The    painter    had    been    busy    mixing    his    colours    and    getting    his    brushes    ready.    He    was    looking    worried,    and 313 312  when    he    heard    Lord    Henry’s    last    remark,    he    glanced    at    him,    hesitated    for    a    moment,    and    then    said,    “Harry,    I 314 313  want    to    finish    this    picture    to-day.    Would    you    think    it    awfully    rude    of    me    if    I    asked    you    to    go    away?” 315 314  Lord    Henry    smiled    and    looked    at    Dorian    Gray.    “Am    I    to    go,    Mr.    Gray?”    he    asked. 316 315  “Oh,    please    don’t,    Lord    Henry.    I    see    that    Basil    is    in    one    of    his    sulky    moods,    and    I    can’t    bear    him    when    he 317 316  sulks.    Besides,    I    want    you    to    tell    me    why    I    should    not    go    in    for    philanthropy.” 318 317  “I    don’t    know    that    I    shall    tell    you    that,    Mr.    Gray.    It    is    so    tedious    a    subject    that    one    would    have    to    talk    seriously 319 318  about    it.    But    I    certainly    shall    not    run    away,    now    that    you    have    asked    me    to    stop.    You    don’t    really    mind,    Basil,    do 320 319  you?    You    have    often    told    me    that    you    liked    your    sitters    to    have    some    one    to    chat    to.” 321 320  Hallward    bit    his    lip.    “If    Dorian    wishes    it,    of    course    you    must    stay.    Dorian’s    whims    are    laws    to    everybody, 322 321  except    himself.” 323 322  Lord    Henry    took    up    his    hat    and    gloves.    “You    are    very    pressing,    Basil,    but    I    am    afraid    I    must    go.    I    have 324 323  promised    to    meet    a    man    at    the    Orleans.    Good-bye,    Mr.    Gray.    Come    and    see    me    some    afternoon    in    Curzon 325 324  Street.    I    am    nearly    always    at    home    at    ﬁve    o’clock.    Write    to    me    when    you    are    coming.    I    should    be    sorry    to    miss 326 325  you.” 327 326  “Basil,”    cried    Dorian    Gray,    “if    Lord    Henry    Wotton    goes,    I    shall    go,    too.    You    never    open    your    lips    while    you    are 328 327  painting,    and    it    is    horribly    dull    standing    on    a    platform    and    trying    to    look    pleasant.    Ask    him    to    stay.    I    insist    upon    it. 329 328  “Stay,    Harry,    to    oblige    Dorian,    and    to    oblige    me,”    said    Hallward,    gazing    intently    at    his    picture.    “It    is    quite    true, 330 329  never    talk    when    I    am    working,    and    never    listen    either,    and    it    must    be    dreadfully    tedious    for    my    unfortunate 331 330  sitters.    I    beg    you    to    stay.” 332 331  “But    what    about    my    man    at    the    Orleans?” 333 332  The    painter    laughed.    “I    don’t    think    there    will    be    any    diﬃculty    about    that.    Sit    down    again,    Harry.    And    now, 334 333  Dorian,    get    up    on    the    platform,    and    don’t    move    about    too    much,    or    pay    any    attention    to    what    Lord    Henry    says. 335 334  He    has    a    very    bad    influence    over    all    his    friends,    with    the    single    exception    of    myself.” 336 335  Dorian    Gray    stepped    up    on    the    dais    with    the    air    of    a    young    Greek    martyr,    and    made    a    little    moue    of    discontent 337 336  to    Lord    Henry,    to    whom    he    had    rather    taken    a    fancy.    He    was    so    unlike    Basil.    They    made    a    delightful    contrast. 338 337  And    he    had    such    a    beautiful    voice.    After    a    few    moments    he    said    to    him,    “Have    you    really    a    very    bad    inﬂuence, 339 338  Lord    Henry?    As    bad    as    Basil    says?” 340 339  “There    is    no    such    thing    as    a    good    inﬂuence,    Mr.    Gray.    All    inﬂuence    is    immoral—immoral    from    the    scientiﬁc 341 340  point    of    view.” 342 341  “Why?” 343 342  “Because    to    inﬂuence    a    person    is    to    give    him    one’s    own    soul.    He    does    not    think    his    natural    thoughts,    or    burn 344 343  with    his    natural    passions.    His    virtues    are    not    real    to    him.    His    sins,    if    there    are    such    things    as    sins,    are    borrowed. 345 344  He    becomes    an    echo    of    some    one    else’s    music,    an    actor    of    a    part    that    has    not    been    written    for    him.    The    aim    of 346 345  life    is    self-development.    To    realize    one’s    nature    perfectly—that    is    what    each    of    us    is    here    for.    People    are    afraid 347 346  of    themselves,    nowadays.    They    have    forgotten    the    highest    of    all    duties,    the    duty    that    one    owes    to    one’s    self.    Of 348 347  course,    they    are    charitable.    They    feed    the    hungry    and    clothe    the    beggar.    But    their    own    souls    starve,    and    are 349 348  naked.    Courage    has    gone    out    of    our    race.    Perhaps    we    never    really    had    it.    The    terror    of    society,    which    is    the 350 349  basis    of    morals,    the    terror    of    God,    which    is    the    secret    of    religion—these    are    the    two    things    that    govern    us.    And 351 350  yet—” 352 351  \\x0c            “Just    turn    your    head    a    little    more    to    the    right,    Dorian,    like    a    good    boy,”    said    the    painter,    deep    in    his    work    and 353 352  conscious    only    that    a    look    had    come    into    the    lad’s    face    that    he    had    never    seen    there    before. 354 353  “And    yet,”    continued    Lord    Henry,    in    his    low,    musical    voice,    and    with    that    graceful    wave    of    the    hand    that    was 355 354  always    so    characteristic    of    him,    and    that    he    had    even    in    his    Eton    days,    “I    believe    that    if    one    man    were    to    live    out 356 355  his    life    fully    and    completely,    were    to    give    form    to    every    feeling,    expression    to    every    thought,    reality    to    every 357 356  dream—I    believe    that    the    world    would    gain    such    a    fresh    impulse    of    joy    that    we    would    forget    all    the    maladies    of 358 357  mediævalism,    and    return    to    the    Hellenic    ideal—to    something    ﬁner,    richer    than    the    Hellenic    ideal,    it    may    be.    But 359 358  the    bravest    man    amongst    us    is    afraid    of    himself.    The    mutilation    of    the    savage    has    its    tragic    survival    in    the    self- 360 359  denial    that    mars    our    lives.    We    are    punished    for    our    refusals.    Every    impulse    that    we    strive    to    strangle    broods    in 361 360  the    mind    and    poisons    us.    The    body    sins    once,    and    has    done    with    its    sin,    for    action    is    a    mode    of    puriﬁcation. 362 361  Nothing    remains    then    but    the    recollection    of    a    pleasure,    or    the    luxury    of    a    regret.    The    only    way    to    get    rid    of    a 363 362  temptation    is    to    yield    to    it.    Resist    it,    and    your    soul    grows    sick    with    longing    for    the    things    it    has    forbidden    to    itself 364 363  with    desire    for    what    its    monstrous    laws    have    made    monstrous    and    unlawful.    It    has    been    said    that    the    great 365 364  events    of    the    world    take    place    in    the    brain.    It    is    in    the    brain,    and    the    brain    only,    that    the    great    sins    of    the    world 366 365  take    place    also.    You,    Mr.    Gray,    you    yourself,    with    your    rose-red    youth    and    your    rose-white    boyhood,    you    have 367 366  had    passions    that    have    made    you    afraid,    thoughts    that    have    ﬁlled    you    with    terror,    day-dreams    and    sleeping 368 367  dreams    whose    mere    memory    might    stain    your    cheek    with    shame—” 369 368  “Stop!”    faltered    Dorian    Gray,    “stop!    you    bewilder    me.    I    don’t    know    what    to    say.    There    is    some    answer    to    you, 370 369  but    I    cannot    find    it.    Don’t    speak.    Let    me    think.    Or,    rather,    let    me    try    not    to    think.” 371 370  For    nearly    ten    minutes    he    stood    there,    motionless,    with    parted    lips    and    eyes    strangely    bright.    He    was    dimly 372 371  conscious    that    entirely    fresh    inﬂuences    were    at    work    within    him.    Yet    they    seemed    to    him    to    have    come    really 373 372  from    himself.    The    few    words    that    Basil’s    friend    had    said    to    him—words    spoken    by    chance,    no    doubt,    and    with 374 373  wilful    paradox    in    them—had    touched    some    secret    chord    that    had    never    been    touched    before,    but    that    he    felt 375 374  was    now    vibrating    and    throbbing    to    curious    pulses. 376 375  Music    had    stirred    him    like    that.    Music    had    troubled    him    many    times.    But    music    was    not    articulate.    It    was    not    a 377 376  new    world,    but    rather    another    chaos,    that    it    created    in    us.    Words!    Mere    words!    How    terrible    they    were!    How 378 377  clear,    and    vivid,    and    cruel!    One    could    not    escape    from    them.    And    yet    what    a    subtle    magic    there    was    in    them! 379 378  They    seemed    to    be    able    to    give    a    plastic    form    to    formless    things,    and    to    have    a    music    of    their    own    as    sweet    as 380 379  that    of    viol    or    of    lute.    Mere    words!    Was    there    anything    so    real    as    words? 381 380  Yes;    there    had    been    things    in    his    boyhood    that    he    had    not    understood.    He    understood    them    now.    Life 382 381  suddenly    became    ﬁery-coloured    to    him.    It    seemed    to    him    that    he    had    been    walking    in    ﬁre.    Why    had    he    not 383 382  known    it? 384 383  With    his    subtle    smile,    Lord    Henry    watched    him.    He    knew    the    precise    psychological    moment    when    to    say 385 384  nothing.    He    felt    intensely    interested.    He    was    amazed    at    the    sudden    impression    that    his    words    had    produced, 386 385  and,    remembering    a    book    that    he    had    read    when    he    was    sixteen,    a    book    which    had    revealed    to    him    much    that 387 386  he    had    not    known    before,    he    wondered    whether    Dorian    Gray    was    passing    through    a    similar    experience.    He    had 388 387  merely    shot    an    arrow    into    the    air.    Had    it    hit    the    mark?    How    fascinating    the    lad    was! 389 388  Hallward    painted    away    with    that    marvellous    bold    touch    of    his,    that    had    the    true    reﬁnement    and    perfect 390 389  delicacy    that    in    art,    at    any    rate    comes    only    from    strength.    He    was    unconscious    of    the    silence. 391 390  “Basil,    I    am    tired    of    standing,”    cried    Dorian    Gray    suddenly.    “I    must    go    out    and    sit    in    the    garden.    The    air    is 392 391  stifling    here.” 393 392  “My    dear    fellow,    I    am    so    sorry.    When    I    am    painting,    I    can’t    think    of    anything    else.    But    you    never    sat    better. 394 393  You    were    perfectly    still.    And    I    have    caught    the    eﬀect    I    wanted—the    half-parted    lips    and    the    bright    look    in    the 395 394  eyes.    I    don’t    know    what    Harry    has    been    saying    to    you,    but    he    has    certainly    made    you    have    the    most    wonderful 396 395  expression.    I    suppose    he    has    been    paying    you    compliments.    You    mustn’t    believe    a    word    that    he    says.” 397 396  “He    has    certainly    not    been    paying    me    compliments.    Perhaps    that    is    the    reason    that    I    don’t    believe    anything    he 398 397  has    told    me.” 399 398  “You    know    you    believe    it    all,”    said    Lord    Henry,    looking    at    him    with    his    dreamy    languorous    eyes.    “I    will    go    out 400 399  to    the    garden    with    you.    It    is    horribly    hot    in    the    studio.    Basil,    let    us    have    something    iced    to    drink,    something    with 401 400  strawberries    in    it.” 402 401  “Certainly,    Harry.    Just    touch    the    bell,    and    when    Parker    comes    I    will    tell    him    what    you    want.    I    have    got    to    work 403 402  up    this    background,    so    I    will    join    you    later    on.    Don’t    keep    Dorian    too    long.    I    have    never    been    in    better    form    for 404 403  painting    than    I    am    to-day.    This    is    going    to    be    my    masterpiece.    It    is    my    masterpiece    as    it    stands.” 405 404  Lord    Henry    went    out    to    the    garden    and    found    Dorian    Gray    burying    his    face    in    the    great    cool    lilac-blossoms, 406 405  feverishly    drinking    in    their    perfume    as    if    it    had    been    wine.    He    came    close    to    him    and    put    his    hand    upon    his 407 406  shoulder.    “You    are    quite    right    to    do    that,”    he    murmured.    “Nothing    can    cure    the    soul    but    the    senses,    just    as 408 407  nothing    can    cure    the    senses    but    the    soul.” 409 408  The    lad    started    and    drew    back.    He    was    bareheaded,    and    the    leaves    had    tossed    his    rebellious    curls    and 410 409  tangled    all    their    gilded    threads.    There    was    a    look    of    fear    in    his    eyes,    such    as    people    have    when    they    are 411 410  suddenly    awakened.    His    ﬁnely    chiselled    nostrils    quivered,    and    some    hidden    nerve    shook    the    scarlet    of    his    lips 412 411  and    left    them    trembling. 413 412  “Yes,”    continued    Lord    Henry,    “that    is    one    of    the    great    secrets    of    life—to    cure    the    soul    by    means    of    the    senses, 414 413  and    the    senses    by    means    of    the    soul.    You    are    a    wonderful    creation.    You    know    more    than    you    think    you    know, 415 414  just    as    you    know    less    than    you    want    to    know.” 416 415  Dorian    Gray    frowned    and    turned    his    head    away.    He    could    not    help    liking    the    tall,    graceful    young    man    who 417 416  was    standing    by    him.    His    romantic,    olive-coloured    face    and    worn    expression    interested    him.    There    was 418 417  something    in    his    low    languid    voice    that    was    absolutely    fascinating.    His    cool,    white,    ﬂowerlike    hands,    even,    had    a 419 418  curious    charm.    They    moved,    as    he    spoke,    like    music,    and    seemed    to    have    a    language    of    their    own.    But    he    felt 420 419  afraid    of    him,    and    ashamed    of    being    afraid.    Why    had    it    been    left    for    a    stranger    to    reveal    him    to    himself?    He    had 421 420  known    Basil    Hallward    for    months,    but    the    friendship    between    them    had    never    altered    him.    Suddenly    there    had 422 421  \\x0ccome    some    one    across    his    life    who    seemed    to    have    disclosed    to    him    life’s    mystery.    And,    yet,    what    was    there    to 423 422  be    afraid    of?    He    was    not    a    schoolboy    or    a    girl.    It    was    absurd    to    be    frightened. 424 423  “Let    us    go    and    sit    in    the    shade,”    said    Lord    Henry.    “Parker    has    brought    out    the    drinks,    and    if    you    stay    any 425 424  longer    in    this    glare,    you    will    be    quite    spoiled,    and    Basil    will    never    paint    you    again.    You    really    must    not    allow 426 425  yourself    to    become    sunburnt.    It    would    be    unbecoming.” 427 426  “What    can    it    matter?”    cried    Dorian    Gray,    laughing,    as    he    sat    down    on    the    seat    at    the    end    of    the    garden. 428 427  “It    should    matter    everything    to    you,    Mr.    Gray.” 429 428  “Why?” 430 429  “Because    you    have    the    most    marvellous    youth,    and    youth    is    the    one    thing    worth    having.” 431 430  “I    don’t    feel    that,    Lord    Henry.” 432 431  “No,    you    don’t    feel    it    now.    Some    day,    when    you    are    old    and    wrinkled    and    ugly,    when    thought    has    seared    your 433 432  forehead    with    its    lines,    and    passion    branded    your    lips    with    its    hideous    ﬁres,    you    will    feel    it,    you    will    feel    it    terribly 434 433  Now,    wherever    you    go,    you    charm    the    world.    Will    it    always    be    so?    ...    You    have    a    wonderfully    beautiful    face,    Mr. 435 434  Gray.    Don’t    frown.    You    have.    And    beauty    is    a    form    of    genius—is    higher,    indeed,    than    genius,    as    it    needs    no 436 435  explanation.    It    is    of    the    great    facts    of    the    world,    like    sunlight,    or    spring-time,    or    the    reﬂection    in    dark    waters    of 437 436  that    silver    shell    we    call    the    moon.    It    cannot    be    questioned.    It    has    its    divine    right    of    sovereignty.    It    makes    princes 438 437  of    those    who    have    it.    You    smile?    Ah!    when    you    have    lost    it    you    won’t    smile....    People    say    sometimes    that    beauty 439 438  is    only    superﬁcial.    That    may    be    so,    but    at    least    it    is    not    so    superﬁcial    as    thought    is.    To    me,    beauty    is    the    wonder 440 439  of    wonders.    It    is    only    shallow    people    who    do    not    judge    by    appearances.    The    true    mystery    of    the    world    is    the 441 440  visible,    not    the    invisible....    Yes,    Mr.    Gray,    the    gods    have    been    good    to    you.    But    what    the    gods    give    they    quickly 442 441  take    away.    You    have    only    a    few    years    in    which    to    live    really,    perfectly,    and    fully.    When    your    youth    goes,    your 443 442  beauty    will    go    with    it,    and    then    you    will    suddenly    discover    that    there    are    no    triumphs    left    for    you,    or    have    to 444 443  content    yourself    with    those    mean    triumphs    that    the    memory    of    your    past    will    make    more    bitter    than    defeats. 445 444  Every    month    as    it    wanes    brings    you    nearer    to    something    dreadful.    Time    is    jealous    of    you,    and    wars    against    your 446 445  lilies    and    your    roses.    You    will    become    sallow,    and    hollow-cheeked,    and    dull-eyed.    You    will    suﬀer    horribly....    Ah! 447 446  realize    your    youth    while    you    have    it.    Don’t    squander    the    gold    of    your    days,    listening    to    the    tedious,    trying    to 448 447  improve    the    hopeless    failure,    or    giving    away    your    life    to    the    ignorant,    the    common,    and    the    vulgar.    These    are 449 448  the    sickly    aims,    the    false    ideals,    of    our    age.    Live!    Live    the    wonderful    life    that    is    in    you!    Let    nothing    be    lost    upon 450 449  you.    Be    always    searching    for    new    sensations.    Be    afraid    of    nothing....    A    new    Hedonism—that    is    what    our    century 451 450  wants.    You    might    be    its    visible    symbol.    With    your    personality    there    is    nothing    you    could    not    do.    The    world 452 451  belongs    to    you    for    a    season....    The    moment    I    met    you    I    saw    that    you    were    quite    unconscious    of    what    you    really 453 452  are,    of    what    you    really    might    be.    There    was    so    much    in    you    that    charmed    me    that    I    felt    I    must    tell    you    something 454 453  about    yourself.    I    thought    how    tragic    it    would    be    if    you    were    wasted.    For    there    is    such    a    little    time    that    your    youth 455 454  will    last—such    a    little    time.    The    common    hill-ﬂowers    wither,    but    they    blossom    again.    The    laburnum    will    be    as 456 455  yellow    next    June    as    it    is    now.    In    a    month    there    will    be    purple    stars    on    the    clematis,    and    year    after    year    the    green 457 456  night    of    its    leaves    will    hold    its    purple    stars.    But    we    never    get    back    our    youth.    The    pulse    of    joy    that    beats    in    us    at 458 457  twenty    becomes    sluggish.    Our    limbs    fail,    our    senses    rot.    We    degenerate    into    hideous    puppets,    haunted    by    the 459 458  memory    of    the    passions    of    which    we    were    too    much    afraid,    and    the    exquisite    temptations    that    we    had    not    the 460 459  courage    to    yield    to.    Youth!    Youth!    There    is    absolutely    nothing    in    the    world    but    youth!” 461 460  Dorian    Gray    listened,    open-eyed    and    wondering.    The    spray    of    lilac    fell    from    his    hand    upon    the    gravel.    A    furry 462 461  bee    came    and    buzzed    round    it    for    a    moment.    Then    it    began    to    scramble    all    over    the    oval    stellated    globe    of    the 463 462  tiny    blossoms.    He    watched    it    with    that    strange    interest    in    trivial    things    that    we    try    to    develop    when    things    of    high 464 463  import    make    us    afraid,    or    when    we    are    stirred    by    some    new    emotion    for    which    we    cannot    ﬁnd    expression,    or 465 464  when    some    thought    that    terriﬁes    us    lays    sudden    siege    to    the    brain    and    calls    on    us    to    yield.    After    a    time    the    bee 466 465  ﬂew    away.    He    saw    it    creeping    into    the    stained    trumpet    of    a    Tyrian    convolvulus.    The    ﬂower    seemed    to    quiver, 467 466  and    then    swayed    gently    to    and    fro. 468 467  Suddenly    the    painter    appeared    at    the    door    of    the    studio    and    made    staccato    signs    for    them    to    come    in.    They 469 468  turned    to    each    other    and    smiled. 470 469  “I    am    waiting,”    he    cried.    “Do    come    in.    The    light    is    quite    perfect,    and    you    can    bring    your    drinks.” 471 470  They    rose    up    and    sauntered    down    the    walk    together.    Two    green-and-white    butterﬂies    ﬂuttered    past    them,    and 472 471  in    the    pear-tree    at    the    corner    of    the    garden    a    thrush    began    to    sing. 473 472  “You    are    glad    you    have    met    me,    Mr.    Gray,”    said    Lord    Henry,    looking    at    him. 474 473  “Yes,    I    am    glad    now.    I    wonder    shall    I    always    be    glad?” 475 474  “Always!    That    is    a    dreadful    word.    It    makes    me    shudder    when    I    hear    it.    Women    are    so    fond    of    using    it.    They 476 475  spoil    every    romance    by    trying    to    make    it    last    for    ever.    It    is    a    meaningless    word,    too.    The    only    diﬀerence    between 477 476  a    caprice    and    a    lifelong    passion    is    that    the    caprice    lasts    a    little    longer.” 478 477  As    they    entered    the    studio,    Dorian    Gray    put    his    hand    upon    Lord    Henry’s    arm.    “In    that    case,    let    our    friendship 479 478  be    a    caprice,”    he    murmured,    ﬂushing    at    his    own    boldness,    then    stepped    up    on    the    platform    and    resumed    his 480 479  pose. 481 480  Lord    Henry    ﬂung    himself    into    a    large    wicker    arm-chair    and    watched    him.    The    sweep    and    dash    of    the    brush    on 482 481  the    canvas    made    the    only    sound    that    broke    the    stillness,    except    when,    now    and    then,    Hallward    stepped    back    to 483 482  look    at    his    work    from    a    distance.    In    the    slanting    beams    that    streamed    through    the    open    doorway    the    dust 484 483  danced    and    was    golden.    The    heavy    scent    of    the    roses    seemed    to    brood    over    everything. 485 484  After    about    a    quarter    of    an    hour    Hallward    stopped    painting,    looked    for    a    long    time    at    Dorian    Gray,    and    then    for 486 485  a    long    time    at    the    picture,    biting    the    end    of    one    of    his    huge    brushes    and    frowning.    “It    is    quite    ﬁnished,”    he    cried 487 486  at    last,    and    stooping    down    he    wrote    his    name    in    long    vermilion    letters    on    the    left-hand    corner    of    the    canvas. 488 487  Lord    Henry    came    over    and    examined    the    picture.    It    was    certainly    a    wonderful    work    of    art,    and    a    wonderful 489 488  likeness    as    well. 490 489  “My    dear    fellow,    I    congratulate    you    most    warmly,”    he    said.    “It    is    the    ﬁnest    portrait    of    modern    times.    Mr.    Gray, 491 490  \\x0ccome    over    and    look    at    yourself.” 492 491  The    lad    started,    as    if    awakened    from    some    dream. 493 492  “Is    it    really    finished?”    he    murmured,    stepping    down    from    the    platform. 494 493  “Quite    finished,”    said    the    painter.    “And    you    have    sat    splendidly    to-day.    I    am    awfully    obliged    to    you.” 495 494  “That    is    entirely    due    to    me,”    broke    in    Lord    Henry.    “Isn’t    it,    Mr.    Gray?” 496 495  Dorian    made    no    answer,    but    passed    listlessly    in    front    of    his    picture    and    turned    towards    it.    When    he    saw    it    he 497 496  drew    back,    and    his    cheeks    ﬂushed    for    a    moment    with    pleasure.    A    look    of    joy    came    into    his    eyes,    as    if    he    had 498 497  recognized    himself    for    the    ﬁrst    time.    He    stood    there    motionless    and    in    wonder,    dimly    conscious    that    Hallward 499 498  was    speaking    to    him,    but    not    catching    the    meaning    of    his    words.    The    sense    of    his    own    beauty    came    on    him    like 500 499  a    revelation.    He    had    never    felt    it    before.    Basil    Hallward’s    compliments    had    seemed    to    him    to    be    merely    the 501 500  charming    exaggeration    of    friendship.    He    had    listened    to    them,    laughed    at    them,    forgotten    them.    They    had    not 502 501  inﬂuenced    his    nature.    Then    had    come    Lord    Henry    Wotton    with    his    strange    panegyric    on    youth,    his    terrible 503 502  warning    of    its    brevity.    That    had    stirred    him    at    the    time,    and    now,    as    he    stood    gazing    at    the    shadow    of    his    own 504 503  loveliness,    the    full    reality    of    the    description    ﬂashed    across    him.    Yes,    there    would    be    a    day    when    his    face    would 505 504  be    wrinkled    and    wizen,    his    eyes    dim    and    colourless,    the    grace    of    his    ﬁgure    broken    and    deformed.    The    scarlet 506 505  would    pass    away    from    his    lips    and    the    gold    steal    from    his    hair.    The    life    that    was    to    make    his    soul    would    mar    his 507 506  body.    He    would    become    dreadful,    hideous,    and    uncouth. 508 507  As    he    thought    of    it,    a    sharp    pang    of    pain    struck    through    him    like    a    knife    and    made    each    delicate    ﬁbre    of    his 509 508  nature    quiver.    His    eyes    deepened    into    amethyst,    and    across    them    came    a    mist    of    tears.    He    felt    as    if    a    hand    of 510 509  ice    had    been    laid    upon    his    heart. 511 510  “Don’t    you    like    it?”    cried    Hallward    at    last,    stung    a    little    by    the    lad’s    silence,    not    understanding    what    it    meant. 512 511  “Of    course    he    likes    it,”    said    Lord    Henry.    “Who    wouldn’t    like    it?    It    is    one    of    the    greatest    things    in    modern    art.    I 513 512  will    give    you    anything    you    like    to    ask    for    it.    I    must    have    it.” 514 513  “It    is    not    my    property,    Harry.” 515 514  “Whose    property    is    it?” 516 515  “Dorian’s,    of    course,”    answered    the    painter. 517 516  “He    is    a    very    lucky    fellow.” 518 517  “How    sad    it    is!”    murmured    Dorian    Gray    with    his    eyes    still    ﬁxed    upon    his    own    portrait.    “How    sad    it    is!    I    shall 519 518  grow    old,    and    horrible,    and    dreadful.    But    this    picture    will    remain    always    young.    It    will    never    be    older    than    this 520 519  particular    day    of    June....    If    it    were    only    the    other    way!    If    it    were    I    who    was    to    be    always    young,    and    the    picture 521 520  that    was    to    grow    old!    For    that—for    that—I    would    give    everything!    Yes,    there    is    nothing    in    the    whole    world    I    would 522 521  not    give!    I    would    give    my    soul    for    that!” 523 522  “You    would    hardly    care    for    such    an    arrangement,    Basil,”    cried    Lord    Henry,    laughing.    “It    would    be    rather    hard 524 523  lines    on    your    work.” 525 524  “I    should    object    very    strongly,    Harry,”    said    Hallward. 526 525  Dorian    Gray    turned    and    looked    at    him.    “I    believe    you    would,    Basil.    You    like    your    art    better    than    your    friends.    I 527 526  am    no    more    to    you    than    a    green    bronze    figure.    Hardly    as    much,    I    dare    say.” 528 527  The    painter    stared    in    amazement.    It    was    so    unlike    Dorian    to    speak    like    that.    What    had    happened?    He    seemed 529 528  quite    angry.    His    face    was    flushed    and    his    cheeks    burning. 530 529  “Yes,”    he    continued,    “I    am    less    to    you    than    your    ivory    Hermes    or    your    silver    Faun.    You    will    like    them    always. 531 530  How    long    will    you    like    me?    Till    I    have    my    ﬁrst    wrinkle,    I    suppose.    I    know,    now,    that    when    one    loses    one’s    good 532 531  looks,    whatever    they    may    be,    one    loses    everything.    Your    picture    has    taught    me    that.    Lord    Henry    Wotton    is 533 532  perfectly    right.    Youth    is    the    only    thing    worth    having.    When    I    find    that    I    am    growing    old,    I    shall    kill    myself.” 534 533  Hallward    turned    pale    and    caught    his    hand.    “Dorian!    Dorian!”    he    cried,    “don’t    talk    like    that.    I    have    never    had 535 534  such    a    friend    as    you,    and    I    shall    never    have    such    another.    You    are    not    jealous    of    material    things,    are    you?—you 536 535  who    are    finer    than    any    of    them!” 537 536  “I    am    jealous    of    everything    whose    beauty    does    not    die.    I    am    jealous    of    the    portrait    you    have    painted    of    me. 538 537  Why    should    it    keep    what    I    must    lose?    Every    moment    that    passes    takes    something    from    me    and    gives    something 539 538  to    it.    Oh,    if    it    were    only    the    other    way!    If    the    picture    could    change,    and    I    could    be    always    what    I    am    now!    Why    did 540 539  you    paint    it?    It    will    mock    me    some    day—mock    me    horribly!”    The    hot    tears    welled    into    his    eyes;    he    tore    his    hand 541 540  away    and,    flinging    himself    on    the    divan,    he    buried    his    face    in    the    cushions,    as    though    he    was    praying. 542 541  “This    is    your    doing,    Harry,”    said    the    painter    bitterly. 543 542  Lord    Henry    shrugged    his    shoulders.    “It    is    the    real    Dorian    Gray—that    is    all.” 544 543  “It    is    not.” 545 544  “If    it    is    not,    what    have    I    to    do    with    it?” 546 545  “You    should    have    gone    away    when    I    asked    you,”    he    muttered. 547 546  “I    stayed    when    you    asked    me,”    was    Lord    Henry’s    answer. 548 547  “Harry,    I    can’t    quarrel    with    my    two    best    friends    at    once,    but    between    you    both    you    have    made    me    hate    the 549 548  ﬁnest    piece    of    work    I    have    ever    done,    and    I    will    destroy    it.    What    is    it    but    canvas    and    colour?    I    will    not    let    it    come 550 549  across    our    three    lives    and    mar    them.” 551 550  Dorian    Gray    lifted    his    golden    head    from    the    pillow,    and    with    pallid    face    and    tear-stained    eyes,    looked    at    him 552 551  as    he    walked    over    to    the    deal    painting-table    that    was    set    beneath    the    high    curtained    window.    What    was    he 553 552  doing    there?    His    ﬁngers    were    straying    about    among    the    litter    of    tin    tubes    and    dry    brushes,    seeking    for 554 553  something.    Yes,    it    was    for    the    long    palette-knife,    with    its    thin    blade    of    lithe    steel.    He    had    found    it    at    last.    He    was 555 554  going    to    rip    up    the    canvas. 556 555  With    a    stiﬂed    sob    the    lad    leaped    from    the    couch,    and,    rushing    over    to    Hallward,    tore    the    knife    out    of    his    hand, 557 556  and    flung    it    to    the    end    of    the    studio.    “Don’t,    Basil,    don’t!”    he    cried.    “It    would    be    murder!” 558 557  \\x0c                “I    am    glad    you    appreciate    my    work    at    last,    Dorian,”    said    the    painter    coldly    when    he    had    recovered    from    his 559 558  surprise.    “I    never    thought    you    would.” 560 559  “Appreciate    it?    I    am    in    love    with    it,    Basil.    It    is    part    of    myself.    I    feel    that.” 561 560  “Well,    as    soon    as    you    are    dry,    you    shall    be    varnished,    and    framed,    and    sent    home.    Then    you    can    do    what    you 562 561  like    with    yourself.”    And    he    walked    across    the    room    and    rang    the    bell    for    tea.    “You    will    have    tea,    of    course, 563 562  Dorian?    And    so    will    you,    Harry?    Or    do    you    object    to    such    simple    pleasures?” 564 563  “I    adore    simple    pleasures,”    said    Lord    Henry.    “They    are    the    last    refuge    of    the    complex.    But    I    don’t    like    scenes, 565 564  except    on    the    stage.    What    absurd    fellows    you    are,    both    of    you!    I    wonder    who    it    was    deﬁned    man    as    a    rational 566 565  animal.    It    was    the    most    premature    deﬁnition    ever    given.    Man    is    many    things,    but    he    is    not    rational.    I    am    glad    he 567 566  is    not,    after    all—though    I    wish    you    chaps    would    not    squabble    over    the    picture.    You    had    much    better    let    me    have 568 567  it,    Basil.    This    silly    boy    doesn’t    really    want    it,    and    I    really    do.” 569 568  “If    you    let    any    one    have    it    but    me,    Basil,    I    shall    never    forgive    you!”    cried    Dorian    Gray;    “and    I    don’t    allow    people 570 569  to    call    me    a    silly    boy.” 571 570  “You    know    the    picture    is    yours,    Dorian.    I    gave    it    to    you    before    it    existed.” 572 571  “And    you    know    you    have    been    a    little    silly,    Mr.    Gray,    and    that    you    don’t    really    object    to    being    reminded    that 573 572  you    are    extremely    young.” 574 573  “I    should    have    objected    very    strongly    this    morning,    Lord    Henry.” 575 574  “Ah!    this    morning!    You    have    lived    since    then.” 576 575  There    came    a    knock    at    the    door,    and    the    butler    entered    with    a    laden    tea-tray    and    set    it    down    upon    a    small 577 576  Japanese    table.    There    was    a    rattle    of    cups    and    saucers    and    the    hissing    of    a    ﬂuted    Georgian    urn.    Two    globe- 578 577  shaped    china    dishes    were    brought    in    by    a    page.    Dorian    Gray    went    over    and    poured    out    the    tea.    The    two    men 579 578  sauntered    languidly    to    the    table    and    examined    what    was    under    the    covers. 580 579  “Let    us    go    to    the    theatre    to-night,”    said    Lord    Henry.    “There    is    sure    to    be    something    on,    somewhere.    I    have 581 580  promised    to    dine    at    White’s,    but    it    is    only    with    an    old    friend,    so    I    can    send    him    a    wire    to    say    that    I    am    ill,    or    t 582 581  am    prevented    from    coming    in    consequence    of    a    subsequent    engagement.    I    think    that    would    be    a    rather    nice 583 582  excuse:    it    would    have    all    the    surprise    of    candour.” 584 583  “It    is    such    a    bore    putting    on    one’s    dress-clothes,”    muttered    Hallward.    “And,    when    one    has    them    on,    they    are 585 584  so    horrid.” 586 585  “Yes,”    answered    Lord    Henry    dreamily,    “the    costume    of    the    nineteenth    century    is    detestable.    It    is    so    sombre, 587 586  so    depressing.    Sin    is    the    only    real    colour-element    left    in    modern    life.” 588 587  “You    really    must    not    say    things    like    that    before    Dorian,    Harry.” 589 588  “Before    which    Dorian?    The    one    who    is    pouring    out    tea    for    us,    or    the    one    in    the    picture?” 590 589  “Before    either.” 591 590  “I    should    like    to    come    to    the    theatre    with    you,    Lord    Henry,”    said    the    lad. 592 591  “Then    you    shall    come;    and    you    will    come,    too,    Basil,    won’t    you?” 593 592  “I    can’t,    really.    I    would    sooner    not.    I    have    a    lot    of    work    to    do.” 594 593  “Well,    then,    you    and    I    will    go    alone,    Mr.    Gray.” 595 594  “I    should    like    that    awfully.” 596 595  The    painter    bit    his    lip    and    walked    over,    cup    in    hand,    to    the    picture.    “I    shall    stay    with    the    real    Dorian,”    he    said, 597 596  sadly. 598 597  “Is    it    the    real    Dorian?”    cried    the    original    of    the    portrait,    strolling    across    to    him.    “Am    I    really    like    that?” 599 598  “Yes;    you    are    just    like    that.” 600 599  “How    wonderful,    Basil!” 601 600  “At    least    you    are    like    it    in    appearance.    But    it    will    never    alter,”    sighed    Hallward.    “That    is    something.” 602 601  “What    a    fuss    people    make    about    ﬁdelity!”    exclaimed    Lord    Henry.    “Why,    even    in    love    it    is    purely    a    question    for 603 602  physiology.    It    has    nothing    to    do    with    our    own    will.    Young    men    want    to    be    faithful,    and    are    not;    old    men    want    to 604 603  be    faithless,    and    cannot:    that    is    all    one    can    say.” 605 604  “Don’t    go    to    the    theatre    to-night,    Dorian,”    said    Hallward.    “Stop    and    dine    with    me.” 606 605  “I    can’t,    Basil.” 607 606  “Why?” 608 607  “Because    I    have    promised    Lord    Henry    Wotton    to    go    with    him.” 609 608  “He    won’t    like    you    the    better    for    keeping    your    promises.    He    always    breaks    his    own.    I    beg    you    not    to    go.” 610 609  Dorian    Gray    laughed    and    shook    his    head. 611 610  “I    entreat    you.” 612 611  The    lad    hesitated,    and    looked    over    at    Lord    Henry,    who    was    watching    them    from    the    tea-table    with    an    amused 613 612  smile. 614 613  “I    must    go,    Basil,”    he    answered. 615 614  “Very    well,”    said    Hallward,    and    he    went    over    and    laid    down    his    cup    on    the    tray.    “It    is    rather    late,    and,    as    you 616 615  have    to    dress,    you    had    better    lose    no    time.    Good-bye,    Harry.    Good-bye,    Dorian.    Come    and    see    me    soon.    Come 617 616  to-morrow.” 618 617  “Certainly.” 619 618  “You    won’t    forget?” 620 619  “No,    of    course    not,”    cried    Dorian. 621 620  “And    ...    Harry!” 622 621  “Yes,    Basil?” 623 622  \\x0c        “Remember    what    I    asked    you,    when    we    were    in    the    garden    this    morning.” 624 623  “I    have    forgotten    it.” 625 624  “I    trust    you.” 626 625  “I    wish    I    could    trust    myself,”    said    Lord    Henry,    laughing.    “Come,    Mr.    Gray,    my    hansom    is    outside,    and    I    can 627 626  drop    you    at    your    own    place.    Good-bye,    Basil.    It    has    been    a    most    interesting    afternoon.” 628 627  As    the    door    closed    behind    them,    the    painter    ﬂung    himself    down    on    a    sofa,    and    a    look    of    pain    came    into    his 629 628  face. 630 629  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                            CHAPTER    III. 631 630  At    half-past    twelve    next    day    Lord    Henry    Wotton    strolled    from    Curzon    Street    over    to    the    Albany    to    call    on    his 632 631  uncle,    Lord    Fermor,    a    genial    if    somewhat    rough-mannered    old    bachelor,    whom    the    outside    world    called    selﬁsh 633 632  because    it    derived    no    particular    beneﬁt    from    him,    but    who    was    considered    generous    by    Society    as    he    fed    the 634 633  people    who    amused    him.    His    father    had    been    our    ambassador    at    Madrid    when    Isabella    was    young    and    Prim 635 634  unthought    of,    but    had    retired    from    the    diplomatic    service    in    a    capricious    moment    of    annoyance    on    not    being 636 635  oﬀered    the    Embassy    at    Paris,    a    post    to    which    he    considered    that    he    was    fully    entitled    by    reason    of    his    birth,    his 637 636  indolence,    the    good    English    of    his    dispatches,    and    his    inordinate    passion    for    pleasure.    The    son,    who    had    been 638 637  his    father’s    secretary,    had    resigned    along    with    his    chief,    somewhat    foolishly    as    was    thought    at    the    time,    and    on 639 638  succeeding    some    months    later    to    the    title,    had    set    himself    to    the    serious    study    of    the    great    aristocratic    art    of 640 639  doing    absolutely    nothing.    He    had    two    large    town    houses,    but    preferred    to    live    in    chambers    as    it    was    less    trouble, 641 640  and    took    most    of    his    meals    at    his    club.    He    paid    some    attention    to    the    management    of    his    collieries    in    the 642 641  Midland    counties,    excusing    himself    for    this    taint    of    industry    on    the    ground    that    the    one    advantage    of    having    coal 643 642  was    that    it    enabled    a    gentleman    to    aﬀord    the    decency    of    burning    wood    on    his    own    hearth.    In    politics    he    was    a 644 643  Tory,    except    when    the    Tories    were    in    oﬃce,    during    which    period    he    roundly    abused    them    for    being    a    pack    of 645 644  Radicals.    He    was    a    hero    to    his    valet,    who    bullied    him,    and    a    terror    to    most    of    his    relations,    whom    he    bullied    in 646 645  turn.    Only    England    could    have    produced    him,    and    he    always    said    that    the    country    was    going    to    the    dogs.    His 647 646  principles    were    out    of    date,    but    there    was    a    good    deal    to    be    said    for    his    prejudices. 648 647  When    Lord    Henry    entered    the    room,    he    found    his    uncle    sitting    in    a    rough    shooting-coat,    smoking    a    cheroot 649 648  and    grumbling    over    The    Times.    “Well,    Harry,”    said    the    old    gentleman,    “what    brings    you    out    so    early?    I    thought 650 649  you    dandies    never    got    up    till    two,    and    were    not    visible    till    five.” 651 650  “Pure    family    affection,    I    assure    you,    Uncle    George.    I    want    to    get    something    out    of    you.” 652 651  “Money,    I    suppose,”    said    Lord    Fermor,    making    a    wry    face.    “Well,    sit    down    and    tell    me    all    about    it.    Young 653 652  people,    nowadays,    imagine    that    money    is    everything.” 654 653  “Yes,”    murmured    Lord    Henry,    settling    his    button-hole    in    his    coat;    “and    when    they    grow    older    they    know    it.    But    I 655 654  don’t    want    money.    It    is    only    people    who    pay    their    bills    who    want    that,    Uncle    George,    and    I    never    pay    mine. 656 655  Credit    is    the    capital    of    a    younger    son,    and    one    lives    charmingly    upon    it.    Besides,    I    always    deal    with    Dartmoor’s 657 656  tradesmen,    and    consequently    they    never    bother    me.    What    I    want    is    information:    not    useful    information,    of 658 657  course;    useless    information.” 659 658  “Well,    I    can    tell    you    anything    that    is    in    an    English    Blue    Book,    Harry,    although    those    fellows    nowadays    write    a 660 659  lot    of    nonsense.    When    I    was    in    the    Diplomatic,    things    were    much    better.    But    I    hear    they    let    them    in    now    by 661 660  examination.    What    can    you    expect?    Examinations,    sir,    are    pure    humbug    from    beginning    to    end.    If    a    man    is    a 662 661  gentleman,    he    knows    quite    enough,    and    if    he    is    not    a    gentleman,    whatever    he    knows    is    bad    for    him.” 663 662  “Mr.    Dorian    Gray    does    not    belong    to    Blue    Books,    Uncle    George,”    said    Lord    Henry    languidly. 664 663  “Mr.    Dorian    Gray?    Who    is    he?”    asked    Lord    Fermor,    knitting    his    bushy    white    eyebrows. 665 664  “That    is    what    I    have    come    to    learn,    Uncle    George.    Or    rather,    I    know    who    he    is.    He    is    the    last    Lord    Kelso’s 666 665  grandson.    His    mother    was    a    Devereux,    Lady    Margaret    Devereux.    I    want    you    to    tell    me    about    his    mother.    What 667 666  was    she    like?    Whom    did    she    marry?    You    have    known    nearly    everybody    in    your    time,    so    you    might    have    known 668 667  her.    I    am    very    much    interested    in    Mr.    Gray    at    present.    I    have    only    just    met    him.” 669 668  “Kelso’s    grandson!”    echoed    the    old    gentleman.    “Kelso’s    grandson!    ...    Of    course....    I    knew    his    mother 670 669  intimately.    I    believe    I    was    at    her    christening.    She    was    an    extraordinarily    beautiful    girl,    Margaret    Devereux,    and 671 670  made    all    the    men    frantic    by    running    away    with    a    penniless    young    fellow—a    mere    nobody,    sir,    a    subaltern    in    a 672 671  foot    regiment,    or    something    of    that    kind.    Certainly.    I    remember    the    whole    thing    as    if    it    happened    yesterday.    The 673 672  poor    chap    was    killed    in    a    duel    at    Spa    a    few    months    after    the    marriage.    There    was    an    ugly    story    about    it.    They 674 673  said    Kelso    got    some    rascally    adventurer,    some    Belgian    brute,    to    insult    his    son-in-law    in    public—paid    him,    sir,    to 675 674  do    it,    paid    him—and    that    the    fellow    spitted    his    man    as    if    he    had    been    a    pigeon.    The    thing    was    hushed    up,    but, 676 675  egad,    Kelso    ate    his    chop    alone    at    the    club    for    some    time    afterwards.    He    brought    his    daughter    back    with    him,    I 677 676  was    told,    and    she    never    spoke    to    him    again.    Oh,    yes;    it    was    a    bad    business.    The    girl    died,    too,    died    within    a 678 677  year.    So    she    left    a    son,    did    she?    I    had    forgotten    that.    What    sort    of    boy    is    he?    If    he    is    like    his    mother,    he    must    be 679 678  a    good-looking    chap.” 680 679  “He    is    very    good-looking,”    assented    Lord    Henry. 681 680  “I    hope    he    will    fall    into    proper    hands,”    continued    the    old    man.    “He    should    have    a    pot    of    money    waiting    for    him 682 681  if    Kelso    did    the    right    thing    by    him.    His    mother    had    money,    too.    All    the    Selby    property    came    to    her,    through    her 683 682  grandfather.    Her    grandfather    hated    Kelso,    thought    him    a    mean    dog.    He    was,    too.    Came    to    Madrid    once    when    I 684 683  was    there.    Egad,    I    was    ashamed    of    him.    The    Queen    used    to    ask    me    about    the    English    noble    who    was    always 685 684  quarrelling    with    the    cabmen    about    their    fares.    They    made    quite    a    story    of    it.    I    didn’t    dare    show    my    face    at    Court 686 685  for    a    month.    I    hope    he    treated    his    grandson    better    than    he    did    the    jarvies.” 687 686  “I    don’t    know,”    answered    Lord    Henry.    “I    fancy    that    the    boy    will    be    well    oﬀ.    He    is    not    of    age    yet.    He    has    Selby,    I 688 687  know.    He    told    me    so.    And    ...    his    mother    was    very    beautiful?” 689 688  “Margaret    Devereux    was    one    of    the    loveliest    creatures    I    ever    saw,    Harry.    What    on    earth    induced    her    to 690 689  behave    as    she    did,    I    never    could    understand.    She    could    have    married    anybody    she    chose.    Carlington    was    mad 691 690  after    her.    She    was    romantic,    though.    All    the    women    of    that    family    were.    The    men    were    a    poor    lot,    but,    egad!    the 692 691  women    were    wonderful.    Carlington    went    on    his    knees    to    her.    Told    me    so    himself.    She    laughed    at    him,    and    there 693 692  wasn’t    a    girl    in    London    at    the    time    who    wasn’t    after    him.    And    by    the    way,    Harry,    talking    about    silly    marriages, 694 693  what    is    this    humbug    your    father    tells    me    about    Dartmoor    wanting    to    marry    an    American?    Ain’t    English    girls    good 695 694  enough    for    him?” 696 695  “It    is    rather    fashionable    to    marry    Americans    just    now,    Uncle    George.” 697 696  “I’ll    back    English    women    against    the    world,    Harry,”    said    Lord    Fermor,    striking    the    table    with    his    fist. 698 697  \\x0c            “The    betting    is    on    the    Americans.” 699 698  “They    don’t    last,    I    am    told,”    muttered    his    uncle. 700 699  “A    long    engagement    exhausts    them,    but    they    are    capital    at    a    steeplechase.    They    take    things    ﬂying.    I    don’t 701 700  think    Dartmoor    has    a    chance.” 702 701  “Who    are    her    people?”    grumbled    the    old    gentleman.    “Has    she    got    any?” 703 702  Lord    Henry    shook    his    head.    “American    girls    are    as    clever    at    concealing    their    parents,    as    English    women    are 704 703  at    concealing    their    past,”    he    said,    rising    to    go. 705 704  “They    are    pork-packers,    I    suppose?” 706 705  “I    hope    so,    Uncle    George,    for    Dartmoor’s    sake.    I    am    told    that    pork-packing    is    the    most    lucrative    profession    in 707 706  America,    after    politics.” 708 707  “Is    she    pretty?” 709 708  “She    behaves    as    if    she    was    beautiful.    Most    American    women    do.    It    is    the    secret    of    their    charm.” 710 709  “Why    can’t    these    American    women    stay    in    their    own    country?    They    are    always    telling    us    that    it    is    the    paradise 711 710  for    women.” 712 711  “It    is.    That    is    the    reason    why,    like    Eve,    they    are    so    excessively    anxious    to    get    out    of    it,”    said    Lord    Henry. 713 712  “Good-bye,    Uncle    George.    I    shall    be    late    for    lunch,    if    I    stop    any    longer.    Thanks    for    giving    me    the    information    I 714 713  wanted.    I    always    like    to    know    everything    about    my    new    friends,    and    nothing    about    my    old    ones.” 715 714  “Where    are    you    lunching,    Harry?” 716 715  “At    Aunt    Agatha’s.    I    have    asked    myself    and    Mr.    Gray.    He    is    her    latest    protégé.” 717 716  “Humph!    tell    your    Aunt    Agatha,    Harry,    not    to    bother    me    any    more    with    her    charity    appeals.    I    am    sick    of    them. 718 717  Why,    the    good    woman    thinks    that    I    have    nothing    to    do    but    to    write    cheques    for    her    silly    fads.” 719 718  “All    right,    Uncle    George,    I’ll    tell    her,    but    it    won’t    have    any    eﬀect.    Philanthropic    people    lose    all    sense    of 720 719  humanity.    It    is    their    distinguishing    characteristic.” 721 720  The    old    gentleman    growled    approvingly    and    rang    the    bell    for    his    servant.    Lord    Henry    passed    up    the    low 722 721  arcade    into    Burlington    Street    and    turned    his    steps    in    the    direction    of    Berkeley    Square. 723 722  So    that    was    the    story    of    Dorian    Gray’s    parentage.    Crudely    as    it    had    been    told    to    him,    it    had    yet    stirred    him    by 724 723  its    suggestion    of    a    strange,    almost    modern    romance.    A    beautiful    woman    risking    everything    for    a    mad    passion.    A 725 724  few    wild    weeks    of    happiness    cut    short    by    a    hideous,    treacherous    crime.    Months    of    voiceless    agony,    and    then    a 726 725  child    born    in    pain.    The    mother    snatched    away    by    death,    the    boy    left    to    solitude    and    the    tyranny    of    an    old    and 727 726  loveless    man.    Yes;    it    was    an    interesting    background.    It    posed    the    lad,    made    him    more    perfect,    as    it    were.    Behind 728 727  every    exquisite    thing    that    existed,    there    was    something    tragic.    Worlds    had    to    be    in    travail,    that    the    meanest 729 728  ﬂower    might    blow....    And    how    charming    he    had    been    at    dinner    the    night    before,    as    with    startled    eyes    and    lips 730 729  parted    in    frightened    pleasure    he    had    sat    opposite    to    him    at    the    club,    the    red    candleshades    staining    to    a    richer 731 730  rose    the    wakening    wonder    of    his    face.    Talking    to    him    was    like    playing    upon    an    exquisite    violin.    He    answered    to 732 731  every    touch    and    thrill    of    the    bow....    There    was    something    terribly    enthralling    in    the    exercise    of    inﬂuence.    No 733 732  other    activity    was    like    it.    To    project    one’s    soul    into    some    gracious    form,    and    let    it    tarry    there    for    a    moment;    to 734 733  hear    one’s    own    intellectual    views    echoed    back    to    one    with    all    the    added    music    of    passion    and    youth;    to    convey 735 734  one’s    temperament    into    another    as    though    it    were    a    subtle    ﬂuid    or    a    strange    perfume:    there    was    a    real    joy    in 736 735  that—perhaps    the    most    satisfying    joy    left    to    us    in    an    age    so    limited    and    vulgar    as    our    own,    an    age    grossly    carnal 737 736  in    its    pleasures,    and    grossly    common    in    its    aims....    He    was    a    marvellous    type,    too,    this    lad,    whom    by    so    curious 738 737  a    chance    he    had    met    in    Basil’s    studio,    or    could    be    fashioned    into    a    marvellous    type,    at    any    rate.    Grace    was    his, 739 738  and    the    white    purity    of    boyhood,    and    beauty    such    as    old    Greek    marbles    kept    for    us.    There    was    nothing    that    one 740 739  could    not    do    with    him.    He    could    be    made    a    Titan    or    a    toy.    What    a    pity    it    was    that    such    beauty    was    destined    to 741 740  fade!    ...    And    Basil?    From    a    psychological    point    of    view,    how    interesting    he    was!    The    new    manner    in    art,    the 742 741  fresh    mode    of    looking    at    life,    suggested    so    strangely    by    the    merely    visible    presence    of    one    who    was 743 742  unconscious    of    it    all;    the    silent    spirit    that    dwelt    in    dim    woodland,    and    walked    unseen    in    open    ﬁeld,    suddenly 744 743  showing    herself,    Dryadlike    and    not    afraid,    because    in    his    soul    who    sought    for    her    there    had    been    wakened    that 745 744  wonderful    vision    to    which    alone    are    wonderful    things    revealed;    the    mere    shapes    and    patterns    of    things 746 745  becoming,    as    it    were,    reﬁned,    and    gaining    a    kind    of    symbolical    value,    as    though    they    were    themselves    patterns 747 746  of    some    other    and    more    perfect    form    whose    shadow    they    made    real:    how    strange    it    all    was!    He    remembered 748 747  something    like    it    in    history.    Was    it    not    Plato,    that    artist    in    thought,    who    had    first    analyzed    it?    Was    it    not    Buonarotti 749 748  who    had    carved    it    in    the    coloured    marbles    of    a    sonnet-sequence?    But    in    our    own    century    it    was    strange....    Yes; 750 749  he    would    try    to    be    to    Dorian    Gray    what,    without    knowing    it,    the    lad    was    to    the    painter    who    had    fashioned    the 751 750  wonderful    portrait.    He    would    seek    to    dominate    him—had    already,    indeed,    half    done    so.    He    would    make    that 752 751  wonderful    spirit    his    own.    There    was    something    fascinating    in    this    son    of    love    and    death. 753 752  Suddenly    he    stopped    and    glanced    up    at    the    houses.    He    found    that    he    had    passed    his    aunt’s    some    distance, 754 753  and,    smiling    to    himself,    turned    back.    When    he    entered    the    somewhat    sombre    hall,    the    butler    told    him    that    they 755 754  had    gone    in    to    lunch.    He    gave    one    of    the    footmen    his    hat    and    stick    and    passed    into    the    dining-room. 756 755  “Late    as    usual,    Harry,”    cried    his    aunt,    shaking    her    head    at    him. 757 756  He    invented    a    facile    excuse,    and    having    taken    the    vacant    seat    next    to    her,    looked    round    to    see    who    was 758 757  there.    Dorian    bowed    to    him    shyly    from    the    end    of    the    table,    a    ﬂush    of    pleasure    stealing    into    his    cheek.    Opposite 759 758  was    the    Duchess    of    Harley,    a    lady    of    admirable    good-nature    and    good    temper,    much    liked    by    every    one    who 760 759  knew    her,    and    of    those    ample    architectural    proportions    that    in    women    who    are    not    duchesses    are    described    by 761 760  contemporary    historians    as    stoutness.    Next    to    her    sat,    on    her    right,    Sir    Thomas    Burdon,    a    Radical    member    of 762 761  Parliament,    who    followed    his    leader    in    public    life    and    in    private    life    followed    the    best    cooks,    dining    with    the 763 762  Tories    and    thinking    with    the    Liberals,    in    accordance    with    a    wise    and    well-known    rule.    The    post    on    her    left    was 764 763  occupied    by    Mr.    Erskine    of    Treadley,    an    old    gentleman    of    considerable    charm    and    culture,    who    had    fallen, 765 764  however,    into    bad    habits    of    silence,    having,    as    he    explained    once    to    Lady    Agatha,    said    everything    that    he    had    to 766 765  say    before    he    was    thirty.    His    own    neighbour    was    Mrs.    Vandeleur,    one    of    his    aunt’s    oldest    friends,    a    perfect    saint 767 766  \\x0camongst    women,    but    so    dreadfully    dowdy    that    she    reminded    one    of    a    badly    bound    hymn-book.    Fortunately    for 768 767  him    she    had    on    the    other    side    Lord    Faudel,    a    most    intelligent    middle-aged    mediocrity,    as    bald    as    a    ministerial 769 768  statement    in    the    House    of    Commons,    with    whom    she    was    conversing    in    that    intensely    earnest    manner    which    is 770 769  the    one    unpardonable    error,    as    he    remarked    once    himself,    that    all    really    good    people    fall    into,    and    from    which 771 770  none    of    them    ever    quite    escape. 772 771  “We    are    talking    about    poor    Dartmoor,    Lord    Henry,”    cried    the    duchess,    nodding    pleasantly    to    him    across    the 773 772  table.    “Do    you    think    he    will    really    marry    this    fascinating    young    person?” 774 773  “I    believe    she    has    made    up    her    mind    to    propose    to    him,    Duchess.” 775 774  “How    dreadful!”    exclaimed    Lady    Agatha.    “Really,    some    one    should    interfere.” 776 775  “I    am    told,    on    excellent    authority,    that    her    father    keeps    an    American    dry-goods    store,”    said    Sir    Thomas 777 776  Burdon,    looking    supercilious. 778 777  “My    uncle    has    already    suggested    pork-packing,    Sir    Thomas.” 779 778  “Dry-goods!    What    are    American    dry-goods?”    asked    the    duchess,    raising    her    large    hands    in    wonder    and 780 779  accentuating    the    verb. 781 780  “American    novels,”    answered    Lord    Henry,    helping    himself    to    some    quail. 782 781  The    duchess    looked    puzzled. 783 782  “Don’t    mind    him,    my    dear,”    whispered    Lady    Agatha.    “He    never    means    anything    that    he    says.” 784 783  “When    America    was    discovered,”    said    the    Radical    member—and    he    began    to    give    some    wearisome    facts. 785 784  Like    all    people    who    try    to    exhaust    a    subject,    he    exhausted    his    listeners.    The    duchess    sighed    and    exercised    her 786 785  privilege    of    interruption.    “I    wish    to    goodness    it    never    had    been    discovered    at    all!”    she    exclaimed.    “Really,    our 787 786  girls    have    no    chance    nowadays.    It    is    most    unfair.” 788 787  “Perhaps,    after    all,    America    never    has    been    discovered,”    said    Mr.    Erskine;    “I    myself    would    say    that    it    had 789 788  merely    been    detected.” 790 789  “Oh!    but    I    have    seen    specimens    of    the    inhabitants,”    answered    the    duchess    vaguely.    “I    must    confess    that    most 791 790  of    them    are    extremely    pretty.    And    they    dress    well,    too.    They    get    all    their    dresses    in    Paris.    I    wish    I    could    aﬀord    to 792 791  do    the    same.” 793 792  “They    say    that    when    good    Americans    die    they    go    to    Paris,”    chuckled    Sir    Thomas,    who    had    a    large    wardrobe 794 793  of    Humour’s    cast-off    clothes. 795 794  “Really!    And    where    do    bad    Americans    go    to    when    they    die?”    inquired    the    duchess. 796 795  “They    go    to    America,”    murmured    Lord    Henry. 797 796  Sir    Thomas    frowned.    “I    am    afraid    that    your    nephew    is    prejudiced    against    that    great    country,”    he    said    to    Lady 798 797  Agatha.    “I    have    travelled    all    over    it    in    cars    provided    by    the    directors,    who,    in    such    matters,    are    extremely    civil.    I 799 798  assure    you    that    it    is    an    education    to    visit    it.” 800 799  “But    must    we    really    see    Chicago    in    order    to    be    educated?”    asked    Mr.    Erskine    plaintively.    “I    don’t    feel    up    to    the 801 800  journey.” 802 801  Sir    Thomas    waved    his    hand.    “Mr.    Erskine    of    Treadley    has    the    world    on    his    shelves.    We    practical    men    like    to 803 802  see    things,    not    to    read    about    them.    The    Americans    are    an    extremely    interesting    people.    They    are    absolutely 804 803  reasonable.    I    think    that    is    their    distinguishing    characteristic.    Yes,    Mr.    Erskine,    an    absolutely    reasonable    people.    I 805 804  assure    you    there    is    no    nonsense    about    the    Americans.” 806 805  “How    dreadful!”    cried    Lord    Henry.    “I    can    stand    brute    force,    but    brute    reason    is    quite    unbearable.    There    is 807 806  something    unfair    about    its    use.    It    is    hitting    below    the    intellect.” 808 807  “I    do    not    understand    you,”    said    Sir    Thomas,    growing    rather    red. 809 808  “I    do,    Lord    Henry,”    murmured    Mr.    Erskine,    with    a    smile. 810 809  “Paradoxes    are    all    very    well    in    their    way....”    rejoined    the    baronet. 811 810  “Was    that    a    paradox?”    asked    Mr.    Erskine.    “I    did    not    think    so.    Perhaps    it    was.    Well,    the    way    of    paradoxes    is 812 811  the    way    of    truth.    To    test    reality    we    must    see    it    on    the    tight    rope.    When    the    verities    become    acrobats,    we    can 813 812  judge    them.” 814 813  “Dear    me!”    said    Lady    Agatha,    “how    you    men    argue!    I    am    sure    I    never    can    make    out    what    you    are    talking 815 814  about.    Oh!    Harry,    I    am    quite    vexed    with    you.    Why    do    you    try    to    persuade    our    nice    Mr.    Dorian    Gray    to    give    up    the 816 815  East    End?    I    assure    you    he    would    be    quite    invaluable.    They    would    love    his    playing.” 817 816  “I    want    him    to    play    to    me,”    cried    Lord    Henry,    smiling,    and    he    looked    down    the    table    and    caught    a    bright 818 817  answering    glance. 819 818  “But    they    are    so    unhappy    in    Whitechapel,”    continued    Lady    Agatha. 820 819  “I    can    sympathize    with    everything    except    suﬀering,”    said    Lord    Henry,    shrugging    his    shoulders.    “I    cannot 821 820  sympathize    with    that.    It    is    too    ugly,    too    horrible,    too    distressing.    There    is    something    terribly    morbid    in    the    modern 822 821  sympathy    with    pain.    One    should    sympathize    with    the    colour,    the    beauty,    the    joy    of    life.    The    less    said    about    life’s 823 822  sores,    the    better.” 824 823  “Still,    the    East    End    is    a    very    important    problem,”    remarked    Sir    Thomas    with    a    grave    shake    of    the    head. 825 824  “Quite    so,”    answered    the    young    lord.    “It    is    the    problem    of    slavery,    and    we    try    to    solve    it    by    amusing    the 826 825  slaves.” 827 826  The    politician    looked    at    him    keenly.    “What    change    do    you    propose,    then?”    he    asked. 828 827  Lord    Henry    laughed.    “I    don’t    desire    to    change    anything    in    England    except    the    weather,”    he    answered.    “I    am 829 828  quite    content    with    philosophic    contemplation.    But,    as    the    nineteenth    century    has    gone    bankrupt    through    an    over- 830 829  expenditure    of    sympathy,    I    would    suggest    that    we    should    appeal    to    science    to    put    us    straight.    The    advantage    of 831 830  the    emotions    is    that    they    lead    us    astray,    and    the    advantage    of    science    is    that    it    is    not    emotional.” 832 831  “But    we    have    such    grave    responsibilities,”    ventured    Mrs.    Vandeleur    timidly. 833 832  “Terribly    grave,”    echoed    Lady    Agatha. 834 833  \\x0c                Lord    Henry    looked    over    at    Mr.    Erskine.    “Humanity    takes    itself    too    seriously.    It    is    the    world’s    original    sin.    If    th 835 834  caveman    had    known    how    to    laugh,    history    would    have    been    different.” 836 835  “You    are    really    very    comforting,”    warbled    the    duchess.    “I    have    always    felt    rather    guilty    when    I    came    to    see 837 836  your    dear    aunt,    for    I    take    no    interest    at    all    in    the    East    End.    For    the    future    I    shall    be    able    to    look    her    in    the    fac 838 837  without    a    blush.” 839 838  “A    blush    is    very    becoming,    Duchess,”    remarked    Lord    Henry. 840 839  “Only    when    one    is    young,”    she    answered.    “When    an    old    woman    like    myself    blushes,    it    is    a    very    bad    sign.    Ah! 841 840  Lord    Henry,    I    wish    you    would    tell    me    how    to    become    young    again.” 842 841  He    thought    for    a    moment.    “Can    you    remember    any    great    error    that    you    committed    in    your    early    days, 843 842  Duchess?”    he    asked,    looking    at    her    across    the    table. 844 843  “A    great    many,    I    fear,”    she    cried. 845 844  “Then    commit    them    over    again,”    he    said    gravely.    “To    get    back    one’s    youth,    one    has    merely    to    repeat    one’s 846 845  follies.” 847 846  “A    delightful    theory!”    she    exclaimed.    “I    must    put    it    into    practice.” 848 847  “A    dangerous    theory!”    came    from    Sir    Thomas’s    tight    lips.    Lady    Agatha    shook    her    head,    but    could    not    help 849 848  being    amused.    Mr.    Erskine    listened. 850 849  “Yes,”    he    continued,    “that    is    one    of    the    great    secrets    of    life.    Nowadays    most    people    die    of    a    sort    of    creeping 851 850  common    sense,    and    discover    when    it    is    too    late    that    the    only    things    one    never    regrets    are    one’s    mistakes.” 852 851  A    laugh    ran    round    the    table. 853 852  He    played    with    the    idea    and    grew    wilful;    tossed    it    into    the    air    and    transformed    it;    let    it    escape    and    recaptured 854 853  it;    made    it    iridescent    with    fancy    and    winged    it    with    paradox.    The    praise    of    folly,    as    he    went    on,    soared    into    a 855 854  philosophy,    and    philosophy    herself    became    young,    and    catching    the    mad    music    of    pleasure,    wearing,    one    might 856 855  fancy,    her    wine-stained    robe    and    wreath    of    ivy,    danced    like    a    Bacchante    over    the    hills    of    life,    and    mocked    the 857 856  slow    Silenus    for    being    sober.    Facts    ﬂed    before    her    like    frightened    forest    things.    Her    white    feet    trod    the    huge 858 857  press    at    which    wise    Omar    sits,    till    the    seething    grape-juice    rose    round    her    bare    limbs    in    waves    of    purple 859 858  bubbles,    or    crawled    in    red    foam    over    the    vat’s    black,    dripping,    sloping    sides.    It    was    an    extraordinary 860 859  improvisation.    He    felt    that    the    eyes    of    Dorian    Gray    were    ﬁxed    on    him,    and    the    consciousness    that    amongst    his 861 860  audience    there    was    one    whose    temperament    he    wished    to    fascinate    seemed    to    give    his    wit    keenness    and    to 862 861  lend    colour    to    his    imagination.    He    was    brilliant,    fantastic,    irresponsible.    He    charmed    his    listeners    out    of 863 862  themselves,    and    they    followed    his    pipe,    laughing.    Dorian    Gray    never    took    his    gaze    oﬀ    him,    but    sat    like    one 864 863  under    a    spell,    smiles    chasing    each    other    over    his    lips    and    wonder    growing    grave    in    his    darkening    eyes. 865 864  At    last,    liveried    in    the    costume    of    the    age,    reality    entered    the    room    in    the    shape    of    a    servant    to    tell    the 866 865  duchess    that    her    carriage    was    waiting.    She    wrung    her    hands    in    mock    despair.    “How    annoying!”    she    cried.    “I 867 866  must    go.    I    have    to    call    for    my    husband    at    the    club,    to    take    him    to    some    absurd    meeting    at    Willis’s    Rooms,    where 868 867  he    is    going    to    be    in    the    chair.    If    I    am    late    he    is    sure    to    be    furious,    and    I    couldn’t    have    a    scene    in    this    bonnet. 869 868  far    too    fragile.    A    harsh    word    would    ruin    it.    No,    I    must    go,    dear    Agatha.    Good-bye,    Lord    Henry,    you    are    quite 870 869  delightful    and    dreadfully    demoralizing.    I    am    sure    I    don’t    know    what    to    say    about    your    views.    You    must    come    and 871 870  dine    with    us    some    night.    Tuesday?    Are    you    disengaged    Tuesday?” 872 871  “For    you    I    would    throw    over    anybody,    Duchess,”    said    Lord    Henry    with    a    bow. 873 872  “Ah!    that    is    very    nice,    and    very    wrong    of    you,”    she    cried;    “so    mind    you    come”;    and    she    swept    out    of    the    room, 874 873  followed    by    Lady    Agatha    and    the    other    ladies. 875 874  When    Lord    Henry    had    sat    down    again,    Mr.    Erskine    moved    round,    and    taking    a    chair    close    to    him,    placed    his 876 875  hand    upon    his    arm. 877 876  “You    talk    books    away,”    he    said;    “why    don’t    you    write    one?” 878 877  “I    am    too    fond    of    reading    books    to    care    to    write    them,    Mr.    Erskine.    I    should    like    to    write    a    novel    certainly,    a 879 878  novel    that    would    be    as    lovely    as    a    Persian    carpet    and    as    unreal.    But    there    is    no    literary    public    in    England    for 880 879  anything    except    newspapers,    primers,    and    encyclopaedias.    Of    all    people    in    the    world    the    English    have    the    least 881 880  sense    of    the    beauty    of    literature.” 882 881  “I    fear    you    are    right,”    answered    Mr.    Erskine.    “I    myself    used    to    have    literary    ambitions,    but    I    gave    them    up    long 883 882  ago.    And    now,    my    dear    young    friend,    if    you    will    allow    me    to    call    you    so,    may    I    ask    if    you    really    meant    all    that    you 884 883  said    to    us    at    lunch?” 885 884  “I    quite    forget    what    I    said,”    smiled    Lord    Henry.    “Was    it    all    very    bad?” 886 885  “Very    bad    indeed.    In    fact    I    consider    you    extremely    dangerous,    and    if    anything    happens    to    our    good    duchess, 887 886  we    shall    all    look    on    you    as    being    primarily    responsible.    But    I    should    like    to    talk    to    you    about    life.    The    generation 888 887  into    which    I    was    born    was    tedious.    Some    day,    when    you    are    tired    of    London,    come    down    to    Treadley    and 889 888  expound    to    me    your    philosophy    of    pleasure    over    some    admirable    Burgundy    I    am    fortunate    enough    to    possess.” 890 889  “I    shall    be    charmed.    A    visit    to    Treadley    would    be    a    great    privilege.    It    has    a    perfect    host,    and    a    perfect    library.” 891 890  “You    will    complete    it,”    answered    the    old    gentleman    with    a    courteous    bow.    “And    now    I    must    bid    good-bye    to 892 891  your    excellent    aunt.    I    am    due    at    the    Athenaeum.    It    is    the    hour    when    we    sleep    there.” 893 892  “All    of    you,    Mr.    Erskine?” 894 893  “Forty    of    us,    in    forty    arm-chairs.    We    are    practising    for    an    English    Academy    of    Letters.” 895 894  Lord    Henry    laughed    and    rose.    “I    am    going    to    the    park,”    he    cried. 896 895  As    he    was    passing    out    of    the    door,    Dorian    Gray    touched    him    on    the    arm.    “Let    me    come    with    you,”    he 897 896  murmured. 898 897  “But    I    thought    you    had    promised    Basil    Hallward    to    go    and    see    him,”    answered    Lord    Henry. 899 898  “I    would    sooner    come    with    you;    yes,    I    feel    I    must    come    with    you.    Do    let    me.    And    you    will    promise    to    talk    to    me 900 899  all    the    time?    No    one    talks    so    wonderfully    as    you    do.” 901 900  \\x0c        “Ah!    I    have    talked    quite    enough    for    to-day,”    said    Lord    Henry,    smiling.    “All    I    want    now    is    to    look    at    life.    You    may 902 901  come    and    look    at    it    with    me,    if    you    care    to.” 903 902  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                            CHAPTER    IV. 904 903  One    afternoon,    a    month    later,    Dorian    Gray    was    reclining    in    a    luxurious    arm-chair,    in    the    little    library    of    Lord 905 904  Henry’s    house    in    Mayfair.    It    was,    in    its    way,    a    very    charming    room,    with    its    high    panelled    wainscoting    of    olive- 906 905  stained    oak,    its    cream-coloured    frieze    and    ceiling    of    raised    plasterwork,    and    its    brickdust    felt    carpet    strewn    with 907 906  silk,    long-fringed    Persian    rugs.    On    a    tiny    satinwood    table    stood    a    statuette    by    Clodion,    and    beside    it    lay    a    copy 908 907  of    Les    Cent    Nouvelles,    bound    for    Margaret    of    Valois    by    Clovis    Eve    and    powdered    with    the    gilt    daisies    that 909 908  Queen    had    selected    for    her    device.    Some    large    blue    china    jars    and    parrot-tulips    were    ranged    on    the 910 909  mantelshelf,    and    through    the    small    leaded    panes    of    the    window    streamed    the    apricot-coloured    light    of    a    summer 911 910  day    in    London. 912 911  Lord    Henry    had    not    yet    come    in.    He    was    always    late    on    principle,    his    principle    being    that    punctuality    is    the 913 912  thief    of    time.    So    the    lad    was    looking    rather    sulky,    as    with    listless    ﬁngers    he    turned    over    the    pages    of    an 914 913  elaborately    illustrated    edition    of    Manon    Lescaut    that    he    had    found    in    one    of    the    book-cases.    The    formal 915 914  monotonous    ticking    of    the    Louis    Quatorze    clock    annoyed    him.    Once    or    twice    he    thought    of    going    away. 916 915  At    last    he    heard    a    step    outside,    and    the    door    opened.    “How    late    you    are,    Harry!”    he    murmured. 917 916  “I    am    afraid    it    is    not    Harry,    Mr.    Gray,”    answered    a    shrill    voice. 918 917  He    glanced    quickly    round    and    rose    to    his    feet.    “I    beg    your    pardon.    I    thought—” 919 918  “You    thought    it    was    my    husband.    It    is    only    his    wife.    You    must    let    me    introduce    myself.    I    know    you    quite    well    by 920 919  your    photographs.    I    think    my    husband    has    got    seventeen    of    them.” 921 920  “Not    seventeen,    Lady    Henry?” 922 921  “Well,    eighteen,    then.    And    I    saw    you    with    him    the    other    night    at    the    opera.”    She    laughed    nervously    as    she 923 922  spoke,    and    watched    him    with    her    vague    forget-me-not    eyes.    She    was    a    curious    woman,    whose    dresses    always 924 923  looked    as    if    they    had    been    designed    in    a    rage    and    put    on    in    a    tempest.    She    was    usually    in    love    with    somebody, 925 924  and,    as    her    passion    was    never    returned,    she    had    kept    all    her    illusions.    She    tried    to    look    picturesque,    but    only 926 925  succeeded    in    being    untidy.    Her    name    was    Victoria,    and    she    had    a    perfect    mania    for    going    to    church. 927 926  “That    was    at    Lohengrin,    Lady    Henry,    I    think?” 928 927  “Yes;    it    was    at    dear    Lohengrin.    I    like    Wagner’s    music    better    than    anybody’s.    It    is    so    loud    that    one    can    talk    the 929 928  whole    time    without    other    people    hearing    what    one    says.    That    is    a    great    advantage,    don’t    you    think    so,    Mr. 930 929  Gray?” 931 930  The    same    nervous    staccato    laugh    broke    from    her    thin    lips,    and    her    ﬁngers    began    to    play    with    a    long    tortoise- 932 931  shell    paper-knife. 933 932  Dorian    smiled    and    shook    his    head:    “I    am    afraid    I    don’t    think    so,    Lady    Henry.    I    never    talk    during    music—at 934 933  least,    during    good    music.    If    one    hears    bad    music,    it    is    one’s    duty    to    drown    it    in    conversation.” 935 934  “Ah!    that    is    one    of    Harry’s    views,    isn’t    it,    Mr.    Gray?    I    always    hear    Harry’s    views    from    his    friends.    It    is    the    only 936 935  way    I    get    to    know    of    them.    But    you    must    not    think    I    don’t    like    good    music.    I    adore    it,    but    I    am    afraid    of    it.    It    ma 937 936  me    too    romantic.    I    have    simply    worshipped    pianists—two    at    a    time,    sometimes,    Harry    tells    me.    I    don’t    know 938 937  what    it    is    about    them.    Perhaps    it    is    that    they    are    foreigners.    They    all    are,    ain’t    they?    Even    those    that    are    born    in 939 938  England    become    foreigners    after    a    time,    don’t    they?    It    is    so    clever    of    them,    and    such    a    compliment    to    art.    Makes 940 939  it    quite    cosmopolitan,    doesn’t    it?    You    have    never    been    to    any    of    my    parties,    have    you,    Mr.    Gray?    You    must 941 940  come.    I    can’t    aﬀord    orchids,    but    I    spare    no    expense    in    foreigners.    They    make    one’s    rooms    look    so    picturesque. 942 941  But    here    is    Harry!    Harry,    I    came    in    to    look    for    you,    to    ask    you    something—I    forget    what    it    was—and    I    found    Mr. 943 942  Gray    here.    We    have    had    such    a    pleasant    chat    about    music.    We    have    quite    the    same    ideas.    No;    I    think    our    ideas 944 943  are    quite    different.    But    he    has    been    most    pleasant.    I    am    so    glad    I’ve    seen    him.” 945 944  “I    am    charmed,    my    love,    quite    charmed,”    said    Lord    Henry,    elevating    his    dark,    crescent-shaped    eyebrows    and 946 945  looking    at    them    both    with    an    amused    smile.    “So    sorry    I    am    late,    Dorian.    I    went    to    look    after    a    piece    of    old 947 946  brocade    in    Wardour    Street    and    had    to    bargain    for    hours    for    it.    Nowadays    people    know    the    price    of    everything 948 947  and    the    value    of    nothing.” 949 948  “I    am    afraid    I    must    be    going,”    exclaimed    Lady    Henry,    breaking    an    awkward    silence    with    her    silly    sudden 950 949  laugh.    “I    have    promised    to    drive    with    the    duchess.    Good-bye,    Mr.    Gray.    Good-bye,    Harry.    You    are    dining    out,    I 951 950  suppose?    So    am    I.    Perhaps    I    shall    see    you    at    Lady    Thornbury’s.” 952 951  “I    dare    say,    my    dear,”    said    Lord    Henry,    shutting    the    door    behind    her    as,    looking    like    a    bird    of    paradise    that    had 953 952  been    out    all    night    in    the    rain,    she    ﬂitted    out    of    the    room,    leaving    a    faint    odour    of    frangipanni.    Then    he    lit    a 954 953  cigarette    and    flung    himself    down    on    the    sofa. 955 954  “Never    marry    a    woman    with    straw-coloured    hair,    Dorian,”    he    said    after    a    few    puffs. 956 955  “Why,    Harry?” 957 956  “Because    they    are    so    sentimental.” 958 957  “But    I    like    sentimental    people.” 959 958  “Never    marry    at    all,    Dorian.    Men    marry    because    they    are    tired;    women,    because    they    are    curious:    both    are 960 959  disappointed.” 961 960  “I    don’t    think    I    am    likely    to    marry,    Harry.    I    am    too    much    in    love.    That    is    one    of    your    aphorisms.    I    am    putting    it 962 961  into    practice,    as    I    do    everything    that    you    say.” 963 962  “Who    are    you    in    love    with?”    asked    Lord    Henry    after    a    pause. 964 963  “With    an    actress,”    said    Dorian    Gray,    blushing. 965 964  Lord    Henry    shrugged    his    shoulders.    “That    is    a    rather    commonplace    début.” 966 965  “You    would    not    say    so    if    you    saw    her,    Harry.” 967 966  “Who    is    she?” 968 967  “Her    name    is    Sibyl    Vane.” 969 968  \\x0c            “Never    heard    of    her.” 970 969  “No    one    has.    People    will    some    day,    however.    She    is    a    genius.” 971 970  “My    dear    boy,    no    woman    is    a    genius.    Women    are    a    decorative    sex.    They    never    have    anything    to    say,    but    they 972 971  say    it    charmingly.    Women    represent    the    triumph    of    matter    over    mind,    just    as    men    represent    the    triumph    of    mind 973 972  over    morals.” 974 973  “Harry,    how    can    you?” 975 974  “My    dear    Dorian,    it    is    quite    true.    I    am    analysing    women    at    present,    so    I    ought    to    know.    The    subject    is    not    so 976 975  abstruse    as    I    thought    it    was.    I    ﬁnd    that,    ultimately,    there    are    only    two    kinds    of    women,    the    plain    and    the 977 976  coloured.    The    plain    women    are    very    useful.    If    you    want    to    gain    a    reputation    for    respectability,    you    have    merely 978 977  to    take    them    down    to    supper.    The    other    women    are    very    charming.    They    commit    one    mistake,    however.    They 979 978  paint    in    order    to    try    and    look    young.    Our    grandmothers    painted    in    order    to    try    and    talk    brilliantly.    Rouge    and 980 979  esprit    used    to    go    together.    That    is    all    over    now.    As    long    as    a    woman    can    look    ten    years    younger    than    her    own 981 980  daughter,    she    is    perfectly    satisﬁed.    As    for    conversation,    there    are    only    ﬁve    women    in    London    worth    talking    to, 982 981  and    two    of    these    can’t    be    admitted    into    decent    society.    However,    tell    me    about    your    genius.    How    long    have    you 983 982  known    her?” 984 983  “Ah!    Harry,    your    views    terrify    me.” 985 984  “Never    mind    that.    How    long    have    you    known    her?” 986 985  “About    three    weeks.” 987 986  “And    where    did    you    come    across    her?” 988 987  “I    will    tell    you,    Harry,    but    you    mustn’t    be    unsympathetic    about    it.    After    all,    it    never    would    have    happened    if    I 989 988  had    not    met    you.    You    ﬁlled    me    with    a    wild    desire    to    know    everything    about    life.    For    days    after    I    met    you, 990 989  something    seemed    to    throb    in    my    veins.    As    I    lounged    in    the    park,    or    strolled    down    Piccadilly,    I    used    to    look    at 991 990  every    one    who    passed    me    and    wonder,    with    a    mad    curiosity,    what    sort    of    lives    they    led.    Some    of    them 992 991  fascinated    me.    Others    ﬁlled    me    with    terror.    There    was    an    exquisite    poison    in    the    air.    I    had    a    passion    for 993 992  sensations....    Well,    one    evening    about    seven    o’clock,    I    determined    to    go    out    in    search    of    some    adventure.    I    felt 994 993  that    this    grey    monstrous    London    of    ours,    with    its    myriads    of    people,    its    sordid    sinners,    and    its    splendid    sins,    as 995 994  you    once    phrased    it,    must    have    something    in    store    for    me.    I    fancied    a    thousand    things.    The    mere    danger    gave 996 995  me    a    sense    of    delight.    I    remembered    what    you    had    said    to    me    on    that    wonderful    evening    when    we    ﬁrst    dined 997 996  together,    about    the    search    for    beauty    being    the    real    secret    of    life.    I    don’t    know    what    I    expected,    but    I    went    out 998 997  and    wandered    eastward,    soon    losing    my    way    in    a    labyrinth    of    grimy    streets    and    black    grassless    squares.    About 999 998  half-past    eight    I    passed    by    an    absurd    little    theatre,    with    great    ﬂaring    gas-jets    and    gaudy    play-bills.    A    hideous 1000 999  Jew,    in    the    most    amazing    waistcoat    I    ever    beheld    in    my    life,    was    standing    at    the    entrance,    smoking    a    vile    cigar. 1001 1000  He    had    greasy    ringlets,    and    an    enormous    diamond    blazed    in    the    centre    of    a    soiled    shirt.    ‘Have    a    box,    my    Lord?’ 1002 1001  he    said,    when    he    saw    me,    and    he    took    oﬀ    his    hat    with    an    air    of    gorgeous    servility.    There    was    something    about 1003 1002  him,    Harry,    that    amused    me.    He    was    such    a    monster.    You    will    laugh    at    me,    I    know,    but    I    really    went    in    and    paid 1004 1003  a    whole    guinea    for    the    stage-box.    To    the    present    day    I    can’t    make    out    why    I    did    so;    and    yet    if    I    hadn’t—my    dear 1005 1004  Harry,    if    I    hadn’t—I    should    have    missed    the    greatest    romance    of    my    life.    I    see    you    are    laughing.    It    is    horrid    of 1006 1005  you!” 1007 1006  “I    am    not    laughing,    Dorian;    at    least    I    am    not    laughing    at    you.    But    you    should    not    say    the    greatest    romance    of 1008 1007  your    life.    You    should    say    the    ﬁrst    romance    of    your    life.    You    will    always    be    loved,    and    you    will    always    be    in    love 1009 1008  with    love.    A    grande    passion    is    the    privilege    of    people    who    have    nothing    to    do.    That    is    the    one    use    of    the    idle 1010 1009  classes    of    a    country.    Don’t    be    afraid.    There    are    exquisite    things    in    store    for    you.    This    is    merely    the    beginning.” 1011 1010  “Do    you    think    my    nature    so    shallow?”    cried    Dorian    Gray    angrily. 1012 1011  “No;    I    think    your    nature    so    deep.” 1013 1012  “How    do    you    mean?” 1014 1013  “My    dear    boy,    the    people    who    love    only    once    in    their    lives    are    really    the    shallow    people.    What    they    call    their 1015 1014  loyalty,    and    their    ﬁdelity,    I    call    either    the    lethargy    of    custom    or    their    lack    of    imagination.    Faithfulness    is    to    the 1016 1015  emotional    life    what    consistency    is    to    the    life    of    the    intellect—simply    a    confession    of    failure.    Faithfulness!    I    must 1017 1016  analyse    it    some    day.    The    passion    for    property    is    in    it.    There    are    many    things    that    we    would    throw    away    if    we 1018 1017  were    not    afraid    that    others    might    pick    them    up.    But    I    don’t    want    to    interrupt    you.    Go    on    with    your    story.” 1019 1018  “Well,    I    found    myself    seated    in    a    horrid    little    private    box,    with    a    vulgar    drop-scene    staring    me    in    the    face.    I 1020 1019  looked    out    from    behind    the    curtain    and    surveyed    the    house.    It    was    a    tawdry    aﬀair,    all    Cupids    and    cornucopias, 1021 1020  like    a    third-rate    wedding-cake.    The    gallery    and    pit    were    fairly    full,    but    the    two    rows    of    dingy    stalls    were    quite 1022 1021  empty,    and    there    was    hardly    a    person    in    what    I    suppose    they    called    the    dress-circle.    Women    went    about    with 1023 1022  oranges    and    ginger-beer,    and    there    was    a    terrible    consumption    of    nuts    going    on.” 1024 1023  “It    must    have    been    just    like    the    palmy    days    of    the    British    drama.” 1025 1024  “Just    like,    I    should    fancy,    and    very    depressing.    I    began    to    wonder    what    on    earth    I    should    do    when    I    caught 1026 1025  sight    of    the    play-bill.    What    do    you    think    the    play    was,    Harry?” 1027 1026  “I    should    think    ‘The    Idiot    Boy’,    or    ‘Dumb    but    Innocent’.    Our    fathers    used    to    like    that    sort    of    piece,    I    believe. 1028 1027  The    longer    I    live,    Dorian,    the    more    keenly    I    feel    that    whatever    was    good    enough    for    our    fathers    is    not    good 1029 1028  enough    for    us.    In    art,    as    in    politics,    les    grandpères    ont    toujours    tort.” 1030 1029  “This    play    was    good    enough    for    us,    Harry.    It    was    Romeo    and    Juliet.    I    must    admit    that    I    was    rather    annoyed    at 1031 1030  the    idea    of    seeing    Shakespeare    done    in    such    a    wretched    hole    of    a    place.    Still,    I    felt    interested,    in    a    sort    of    way. 1032 1031  At    any    rate,    I    determined    to    wait    for    the    ﬁrst    act.    There    was    a    dreadful    orchestra,    presided    over    by    a    young 1033 1032  Hebrew    who    sat    at    a    cracked    piano,    that    nearly    drove    me    away,    but    at    last    the    drop-scene    was    drawn    up    and 1034 1033  the    play    began.    Romeo    was    a    stout    elderly    gentleman,    with    corked    eyebrows,    a    husky    tragedy    voice,    and    a 1035 1034  ﬁgure    like    a    beer-barrel.    Mercutio    was    almost    as    bad.    He    was    played    by    the    low-comedian,    who    had    introduced 1036 1035  gags    of    his    own    and    was    on    most    friendly    terms    with    the    pit.    They    were    both    as    grotesque    as    the    scenery,    and 1037 1036  that    looked    as    if    it    had    come    out    of    a    country-booth.    But    Juliet!    Harry,    imagine    a    girl,    hardly    seventeen    years    of 1038 1037  \\x0cage,    with    a    little,    ﬂowerlike    face,    a    small    Greek    head    with    plaited    coils    of    dark-brown    hair,    eyes    that    were    violet 1039 1038  wells    of    passion,    lips    that    were    like    the    petals    of    a    rose.    She    was    the    loveliest    thing    I    had    ever    seen    in    my    life. 1040 1039  You    said    to    me    once    that    pathos    left    you    unmoved,    but    that    beauty,    mere    beauty,    could    ﬁll    your    eyes    with    tears. 1041 1040  I    tell    you,    Harry,    I    could    hardly    see    this    girl    for    the    mist    of    tears    that    came    across    me.    And    her    voice—I    never 1042 1041  heard    such    a    voice.    It    was    very    low    at    ﬁrst,    with    deep    mellow    notes    that    seemed    to    fall    singly    upon    one’s    ear. 1043 1042  Then    it    became    a    little    louder,    and    sounded    like    a    ﬂute    or    a    distant    hautboy.    In    the    garden-scene    it    had    all    the 1044 1043  tremulous    ecstasy    that    one    hears    just    before    dawn    when    nightingales    are    singing.    There    were    moments,    later 1045 1044  on,    when    it    had    the    wild    passion    of    violins.    You    know    how    a    voice    can    stir    one.    Your    voice    and    the    voice    of    Sibyl 1046 1045  Vane    are    two    things    that    I    shall    never    forget.    When    I    close    my    eyes,    I    hear    them,    and    each    of    them    says 1047 1046  something    diﬀerent.    I    don’t    know    which    to    follow.    Why    should    I    not    love    her?    Harry,    I    do    love    her.    She    is 1048 1047  everything    to    me    in    life.    Night    after    night    I    go    to    see    her    play.    One    evening    she    is    Rosalind,    and    the    next    evening 1049 1048  she    is    Imogen.    I    have    seen    her    die    in    the    gloom    of    an    Italian    tomb,    sucking    the    poison    from    her    lover’s    lips.    I 1050 1049  have    watched    her    wandering    through    the    forest    of    Arden,    disguised    as    a    pretty    boy    in    hose    and    doublet    and 1051 1050  dainty    cap.    She    has    been    mad,    and    has    come    into    the    presence    of    a    guilty    king,    and    given    him    rue    to    wear    and 1052 1051  bitter    herbs    to    taste    of.    She    has    been    innocent,    and    the    black    hands    of    jealousy    have    crushed    her    reedlike 1053 1052  throat.    I    have    seen    her    in    every    age    and    in    every    costume.    Ordinary    women    never    appeal    to    one’s    imagination. 1054 1053  They    are    limited    to    their    century.    No    glamour    ever    transﬁgures    them.    One    knows    their    minds    as    easily    as    one 1055 1054  knows    their    bonnets.    One    can    always    ﬁnd    them.    There    is    no    mystery    in    any    of    them.    They    ride    in    the    park    in    the 1056 1055  morning    and    chatter    at    tea-parties    in    the    afternoon.    They    have    their    stereotyped    smile    and    their    fashionable 1057 1056  manner.    They    are    quite    obvious.    But    an    actress!    How    diﬀerent    an    actress    is!    Harry!    why    didn’t    you    tell    me    that 1058 1057  the    only    thing    worth    loving    is    an    actress?” 1059 1058  “Because    I    have    loved    so    many    of    them,    Dorian.” 1060 1059  “Oh,    yes,    horrid    people    with    dyed    hair    and    painted    faces.” 1061 1060  “Don’t    run    down    dyed    hair    and    painted    faces.    There    is    an    extraordinary    charm    in    them,    sometimes,”    said    Lord 1062 1061  Henry. 1063 1062  “I    wish    now    I    had    not    told    you    about    Sibyl    Vane.” 1064 1063  “You    could    not    have    helped    telling    me,    Dorian.    All    through    your    life    you    will    tell    me    everything    you    do.” 1065 1064  “Yes,    Harry,    I    believe    that    is    true.    I    cannot    help    telling    you    things.    You    have    a    curious    inﬂuence    over    me.    If    I 1066 1065  ever    did    a    crime,    I    would    come    and    confess    it    to    you.    You    would    understand    me.” 1067 1066  “People    like    you—the    wilful    sunbeams    of    life—don’t    commit    crimes,    Dorian.    But    I    am    much    obliged    for    the 1068 1067  compliment,    all    the    same.    And    now    tell    me—reach    me    the    matches,    like    a    good    boy—thanks—what    are    your 1069 1068  actual    relations    with    Sibyl    Vane?” 1070 1069  Dorian    Gray    leaped    to    his    feet,    with    flushed    cheeks    and    burning    eyes.    “Harry!    Sibyl    Vane    is    sacred!” 1071 1070  “It    is    only    the    sacred    things    that    are    worth    touching,    Dorian,”    said    Lord    Henry,    with    a    strange    touch    of    pathos 1072 1071  in    his    voice.    “But    why    should    you    be    annoyed?    I    suppose    she    will    belong    to    you    some    day.    When    one    is    in    love, 1073 1072  one    always    begins    by    deceiving    one’s    self,    and    one    always    ends    by    deceiving    others.    That    is    what    the    world 1074 1073  calls    a    romance.    You    know    her,    at    any    rate,    I    suppose?” 1075 1074  “Of    course    I    know    her.    On    the    ﬁrst    night    I    was    at    the    theatre,    the    horrid    old    Jew    came    round    to    the    box    after 1076 1075  the    performance    was    over    and    oﬀered    to    take    me    behind    the    scenes    and    introduce    me    to    her.    I    was    furious    with 1077 1076  him,    and    told    him    that    Juliet    had    been    dead    for    hundreds    of    years    and    that    her    body    was    lying    in    a    marble    tomb 1078 1077  in    Verona.    I    think,    from    his    blank    look    of    amazement,    that    he    was    under    the    impression    that    I    had    taken    too 1079 1078  much    champagne,    or    something.” 1080 1079  “I    am    not    surprised.” 1081 1080  “Then    he    asked    me    if    I    wrote    for    any    of    the    newspapers.    I    told    him    I    never    even    read    them.    He    seemed    terribly 1082 1081  disappointed    at    that,    and    conﬁded    to    me    that    all    the    dramatic    critics    were    in    a    conspiracy    against    him,    and    that 1083 1082  they    were    every    one    of    them    to    be    bought.” 1084 1083  “I    should    not    wonder    if    he    was    quite    right    there.    But,    on    the    other    hand,    judging    from    their    appearance,    most 1085 1084  of    them    cannot    be    at    all    expensive.” 1086 1085  “Well,    he    seemed    to    think    they    were    beyond    his    means,”    laughed    Dorian.    “By    this    time,    however,    the    lights 1087 1086  were    being    put    out    in    the    theatre,    and    I    had    to    go.    He    wanted    me    to    try    some    cigars    that    he    strongly 1088 1087  recommended.    I    declined.    The    next    night,    of    course,    I    arrived    at    the    place    again.    When    he    saw    me,    he    made    me 1089 1088  a    low    bow    and    assured    me    that    I    was    a    muniﬁcent    patron    of    art.    He    was    a    most    oﬀensive    brute,    though    he    had 1090 1089  an    extraordinary    passion    for    Shakespeare.    He    told    me    once,    with    an    air    of    pride,    that    his    ﬁve    bankruptcies    were 1091 1090  entirely    due    to    ‘The    Bard,’    as    he    insisted    on    calling    him.    He    seemed    to    think    it    a    distinction.” 1092 1091  “It    was    a    distinction,    my    dear    Dorian—a    great    distinction.    Most    people    become    bankrupt    through    having 1093 1092  invested    too    heavily    in    the    prose    of    life.    To    have    ruined    one’s    self    over    poetry    is    an    honour.    But    when    did    you 1094 1093  first    speak    to    Miss    Sibyl    Vane?” 1095 1094  “The    third    night.    She    had    been    playing    Rosalind.    I    could    not    help    going    round.    I    had    thrown    her    some    ﬂowers, 1096 1095  and    she    had    looked    at    me—at    least    I    fancied    that    she    had.    The    old    Jew    was    persistent.    He    seemed    determined 1097 1096  to    take    me    behind,    so    I    consented.    It    was    curious    my    not    wanting    to    know    her,    wasn’t    it?” 1098 1097  “No;    I    don’t    think    so.” 1099 1098  “My    dear    Harry,    why?” 1100 1099  “I    will    tell    you    some    other    time.    Now    I    want    to    know    about    the    girl.” 1101 1100  “Sibyl?    Oh,    she    was    so    shy    and    so    gentle.    There    is    something    of    a    child    about    her.    Her    eyes    opened    wide    in 1102 1101  exquisite    wonder    when    I    told    her    what    I    thought    of    her    performance,    and    she    seemed    quite    unconscious    of    her 1103 1102  power.    I    think    we    were    both    rather    nervous.    The    old    Jew    stood    grinning    at    the    doorway    of    the    dusty    greenroom, 1104 1103  making    elaborate    speeches    about    us    both,    while    we    stood    looking    at    each    other    like    children.    He    would    insist    on 1105 1104  calling    me    ‘My    Lord,’    so    I    had    to    assure    Sibyl    that    I    was    not    anything    of    the    kind.    She    said    quite    simply    to    me, 1106 1105  ‘You    look    more    like    a    prince.    I    must    call    you    Prince    Charming.’” 1107 1106  \\x0c                “Upon    my    word,    Dorian,    Miss    Sibyl    knows    how    to    pay    compliments.” 1108 1107  “You    don’t    understand    her,    Harry.    She    regarded    me    merely    as    a    person    in    a    play.    She    knows    nothing    of    life. 1109 1108  She    lives    with    her    mother,    a    faded    tired    woman    who    played    Lady    Capulet    in    a    sort    of    magenta    dressing-wrapper 1110 1109  on    the    first    night,    and    looks    as    if    she    had    seen    better    days.” 1111 1110  “I    know    that    look.    It    depresses    me,”    murmured    Lord    Henry,    examining    his    rings. 1112 1111  “The    Jew    wanted    to    tell    me    her    history,    but    I    said    it    did    not    interest    me.” 1113 1112  “You    were    quite    right.    There    is    always    something    infinitely    mean    about    other    people’s    tragedies.” 1114 1113  “Sibyl    is    the    only    thing    I    care    about.    What    is    it    to    me    where    she    came    from?    From    her    little    head    to    her    little 1115 1114  feet,    she    is    absolutely    and    entirely    divine.    Every    night    of    my    life    I    go    to    see    her    act,    and    every    night    she    is    more 1116 1115  marvellous.” 1117 1116  “That    is    the    reason,    I    suppose,    that    you    never    dine    with    me    now.    I    thought    you    must    have    some    curious 1118 1117  romance    on    hand.    You    have;    but    it    is    not    quite    what    I    expected.” 1119 1118  “My    dear    Harry,    we    either    lunch    or    sup    together    every    day,    and    I    have    been    to    the    opera    with    you    several 1120 1119  times,”    said    Dorian,    opening    his    blue    eyes    in    wonder. 1121 1120  “You    always    come    dreadfully    late.” 1122 1121  “Well,    I    can’t    help    going    to    see    Sibyl    play,”    he    cried,    “even    if    it    is    only    for    a    single    act.    I    get    hungry    for    her 1123 1122  presence;    and    when    I    think    of    the    wonderful    soul    that    is    hidden    away    in    that    little    ivory    body,    I    am    ﬁlled    with 1124 1123  awe.” 1125 1124  “You    can    dine    with    me    to-night,    Dorian,    can’t    you?” 1126 1125  He    shook    his    head.    “To-night    she    is    Imogen,”    he    answered,    “and    to-morrow    night    she    will    be    Juliet.” 1127 1126  “When    is    she    Sibyl    Vane?” 1128 1127  “Never.” 1129 1128  “I    congratulate    you.” 1130 1129  “How    horrid    you    are!    She    is    all    the    great    heroines    of    the    world    in    one.    She    is    more    than    an    individual.    You 1131 1130  laugh,    but    I    tell    you    she    has    genius.    I    love    her,    and    I    must    make    her    love    me.    You,    who    know    all    the    secrets    of 1132 1131  life,    tell    me    how    to    charm    Sibyl    Vane    to    love    me!    I    want    to    make    Romeo    jealous.    I    want    the    dead    lovers    of    the 1133 1132  world    to    hear    our    laughter    and    grow    sad.    I    want    a    breath    of    our    passion    to    stir    their    dust    into    consciousness,    to 1134 1133  wake    their    ashes    into    pain.    My    God,    Harry,    how    I    worship    her!”    He    was    walking    up    and    down    the    room    as    he 1135 1134  spoke.    Hectic    spots    of    red    burned    on    his    cheeks.    He    was    terribly    excited. 1136 1135  Lord    Henry    watched    him    with    a    subtle    sense    of    pleasure.    How    diﬀerent    he    was    now    from    the    shy    frightened 1137 1136  boy    he    had    met    in    Basil    Hallward’s    studio!    His    nature    had    developed    like    a    ﬂower,    had    borne    blossoms    of 1138 1137  scarlet    flame.    Out    of    its    secret    hiding-place    had    crept    his    soul,    and    desire    had    come    to    meet    it    on    the    way. 1139 1138  “And    what    do    you    propose    to    do?”    said    Lord    Henry    at    last. 1140 1139  “I    want    you    and    Basil    to    come    with    me    some    night    and    see    her    act.    I    have    not    the    slightest    fear    of    the    result. 1141 1140  You    are    certain    to    acknowledge    her    genius.    Then    we    must    get    her    out    of    the    Jew’s    hands.    She    is    bound    to    him 1142 1141  for    three    years—at    least    for    two    years    and    eight    months—from    the    present    time.    I    shall    have    to    pay    him 1143 1142  something,    of    course.    When    all    that    is    settled,    I    shall    take    a    West    End    theatre    and    bring    her    out    properly.    She 1144 1143  will    make    the    world    as    mad    as    she    has    made    me.” 1145 1144  “That    would    be    impossible,    my    dear    boy.” 1146 1145  “Yes,    she    will.    She    has    not    merely    art,    consummate    art-instinct,    in    her,    but    she    has    personality    also;    and    you 1147 1146  have    often    told    me    that    it    is    personalities,    not    principles,    that    move    the    age.” 1148 1147  “Well,    what    night    shall    we    go?” 1149 1148  “Let    me    see.    To-day    is    Tuesday.    Let    us    fix    to-morrow.    She    plays    Juliet    to-morrow.” 1150 1149  “All    right.    The    Bristol    at    eight    o’clock;    and    I    will    get    Basil.” 1151 1150  “Not    eight,    Harry,    please.    Half-past    six.    We    must    be    there    before    the    curtain    rises.    You    must    see    her    in    the 1152 1151  first    act,    where    she    meets    Romeo.” 1153 1152  “Half-past    six!    What    an    hour!    It    will    be    like    having    a    meat-tea,    or    reading    an    English    novel.    It    must    be    seven. 1154 1153  No    gentleman    dines    before    seven.    Shall    you    see    Basil    between    this    and    then?    Or    shall    I    write    to    him?” 1155 1154  “Dear    Basil!    I    have    not    laid    eyes    on    him    for    a    week.    It    is    rather    horrid    of    me,    as    he    has    sent    me    my    portrait    in 1156 1155  the    most    wonderful    frame,    specially    designed    by    himself,    and,    though    I    am    a    little    jealous    of    the    picture    for    being 1157 1156  a    whole    month    younger    than    I    am,    I    must    admit    that    I    delight    in    it.    Perhaps    you    had    better    write    to    him.    I    don’t 1158 1157  want    to    see    him    alone.    He    says    things    that    annoy    me.    He    gives    me    good    advice.” 1159 1158  Lord    Henry    smiled.    “People    are    very    fond    of    giving    away    what    they    need    most    themselves.    It    is    what    I    call    the 1160 1159  depth    of    generosity.” 1161 1160  “Oh,    Basil    is    the    best    of    fellows,    but    he    seems    to    me    to    be    just    a    bit    of    a    Philistine.    Since    I    have    known    you, 1162 1161  Harry,    I    have    discovered    that.” 1163 1162  “Basil,    my    dear    boy,    puts    everything    that    is    charming    in    him    into    his    work.    The    consequence    is    that    he    has 1164 1163  nothing    left    for    life    but    his    prejudices,    his    principles,    and    his    common    sense.    The    only    artists    I    have    ever    known 1165 1164  who    are    personally    delightful    are    bad    artists.    Good    artists    exist    simply    in    what    they    make,    and    consequently    are 1166 1165  perfectly    uninteresting    in    what    they    are.    A    great    poet,    a    really    great    poet,    is    the    most    unpoetical    of    all    creatures. 1167 1166  But    inferior    poets    are    absolutely    fascinating.    The    worse    their    rhymes    are,    the    more    picturesque    they    look.    The 1168 1167  mere    fact    of    having    published    a    book    of    second-rate    sonnets    makes    a    man    quite    irresistible.    He    lives    the    poetry 1169 1168  that    he    cannot    write.    The    others    write    the    poetry    that    they    dare    not    realize.” 1170 1169  “I    wonder    is    that    really    so,    Harry?”    said    Dorian    Gray,    putting    some    perfume    on    his    handkerchief    out    of    a    large, 1171 1170  gold-topped    bottle    that    stood    on    the    table.    “It    must    be,    if    you    say    it.    And    now    I    am    oﬀ.    Imogen    is    waiting    for    me. 1172 1171  Don’t    forget    about    to-morrow.    Good-bye.” 1173 1172  As    he    left    the    room,    Lord    Henry’s    heavy    eyelids    drooped,    and    he    began    to    think.    Certainly    few    people    had 1174 1173  \\x0cever    interested    him    so    much    as    Dorian    Gray,    and    yet    the    lad’s    mad    adoration    of    some    one    else    caused    him    not 1175 1174  the    slightest    pang    of    annoyance    or    jealousy.    He    was    pleased    by    it.    It    made    him    a    more    interesting    study.    He    had 1176 1175  been    always    enthralled    by    the    methods    of    natural    science,    but    the    ordinary    subject-matter    of    that    science    had 1177 1176  seemed    to    him    trivial    and    of    no    import.    And    so    he    had    begun    by    vivisecting    himself,    as    he    had    ended    by 1178 1177  vivisecting    others.    Human    life—that    appeared    to    him    the    one    thing    worth    investigating.    Compared    to    it    there    was 1179 1178  nothing    else    of    any    value.    It    was    true    that    as    one    watched    life    in    its    curious    crucible    of    pain    and    pleasure,    one 1180 1179  could    not    wear    over    one’s    face    a    mask    of    glass,    nor    keep    the    sulphurous    fumes    from    troubling    the    brain    and 1181 1180  making    the    imagination    turbid    with    monstrous    fancies    and    misshapen    dreams.    There    were    poisons    so    subtle 1182 1181  that    to    know    their    properties    one    had    to    sicken    of    them.    There    were    maladies    so    strange    that    one    had    to    pass 1183 1182  through    them    if    one    sought    to    understand    their    nature.    And,    yet,    what    a    great    reward    one    received!    How 1184 1183  wonderful    the    whole    world    became    to    one!    To    note    the    curious    hard    logic    of    passion,    and    the    emotional 1185 1184  coloured    life    of    the    intellect—to    observe    where    they    met,    and    where    they    separated,    at    what    point    they    were    in 1186 1185  unison,    and    at    what    point    they    were    at    discord—there    was    a    delight    in    that!    What    matter    what    the    cost    was? 1187 1186  One    could    never    pay    too    high    a    price    for    any    sensation. 1188 1187  He    was    conscious—and    the    thought    brought    a    gleam    of    pleasure    into    his    brown    agate    eyes—that    it    was 1189 1188  through    certain    words    of    his,    musical    words    said    with    musical    utterance,    that    Dorian    Gray’s    soul    had    turned    to 1190 1189  this    white    girl    and    bowed    in    worship    before    her.    To    a    large    extent    the    lad    was    his    own    creation.    He    had    made 1191 1190  him    premature.    That    was    something.    Ordinary    people    waited    till    life    disclosed    to    them    its    secrets,    but    to    the    few, 1192 1191  to    the    elect,    the    mysteries    of    life    were    revealed    before    the    veil    was    drawn    away.    Sometimes    this    was    the    eﬀect 1193 1192  of    art,    and    chieﬂy    of    the    art    of    literature,    which    dealt    immediately    with    the    passions    and    the    intellect.    But    now 1194 1193  and    then    a    complex    personality    took    the    place    and    assumed    the    oﬃce    of    art,    was    indeed,    in    its    way,    a    real    work 1195 1194  of    art,    life    having    its    elaborate    masterpieces,    just    as    poetry    has,    or    sculpture,    or    painting. 1196 1195  Yes,    the    lad    was    premature.    He    was    gathering    his    harvest    while    it    was    yet    spring.    The    pulse    and    passion    of 1197 1196  youth    were    in    him,    but    he    was    becoming    self-conscious.    It    was    delightful    to    watch    him.    With    his    beautiful    face, 1198 1197  and    his    beautiful    soul,    he    was    a    thing    to    wonder    at.    It    was    no    matter    how    it    all    ended,    or    was    destined    to    end.    He 1199 1198  was    like    one    of    those    gracious    ﬁgures    in    a    pageant    or    a    play,    whose    joys    seem    to    be    remote    from    one,    but 1200 1199  whose    sorrows    stir    one’s    sense    of    beauty,    and    whose    wounds    are    like    red    roses. 1201 1200  Soul    and    body,    body    and    soul—how    mysterious    they    were!    There    was    animalism    in    the    soul,    and    the    body 1202 1201  had    its    moments    of    spirituality.    The    senses    could    reﬁne,    and    the    intellect    could    degrade.    Who    could    say    where 1203 1202  the    ﬂeshly    impulse    ceased,    or    the    psychical    impulse    began?    How    shallow    were    the    arbitrary    deﬁnitions    of 1204 1203  ordinary    psychologists!    And    yet    how    diﬃcult    to    decide    between    the    claims    of    the    various    schools!    Was    the    soul 1205 1204  a    shadow    seated    in    the    house    of    sin?    Or    was    the    body    really    in    the    soul,    as    Giordano    Bruno    thought?    The 1206 1205  separation    of    spirit    from    matter    was    a    mystery,    and    the    union    of    spirit    with    matter    was    a    mystery    also. 1207 1206  He    began    to    wonder    whether    we    could    ever    make    psychology    so    absolute    a    science    that    each    little    spring    of 1208 1207  life    would    be    revealed    to    us.    As    it    was,    we    always    misunderstood    ourselves    and    rarely    understood    others. 1209 1208  Experience    was    of    no    ethical    value.    It    was    merely    the    name    men    gave    to    their    mistakes.    Moralists    had,    as    a 1210 1209  rule,    regarded    it    as    a    mode    of    warning,    had    claimed    for    it    a    certain    ethical    eﬃcacy    in    the    formation    of    character, 1211 1210  had    praised    it    as    something    that    taught    us    what    to    follow    and    showed    us    what    to    avoid.    But    there    was    no    motive 1212 1211  power    in    experience.    It    was    as    little    of    an    active    cause    as    conscience    itself.    All    that    it    really    demonstrated    was 1213 1212  that    our    future    would    be    the    same    as    our    past,    and    that    the    sin    we    had    done    once,    and    with    loathing,    we    would 1214 1213  do    many    times,    and    with    joy. 1215 1214  It    was    clear    to    him    that    the    experimental    method    was    the    only    method    by    which    one    could    arrive    at    any 1216 1215  scientiﬁc    analysis    of    the    passions;    and    certainly    Dorian    Gray    was    a    subject    made    to    his    hand,    and    seemed    to 1217 1216  promise    rich    and    fruitful    results.    His    sudden    mad    love    for    Sibyl    Vane    was    a    psychological    phenomenon    of    no 1218 1217  small    interest.    There    was    no    doubt    that    curiosity    had    much    to    do    with    it,    curiosity    and    the    desire    for    new 1219 1218  experiences,    yet    it    was    not    a    simple,    but    rather    a    very    complex    passion.    What    there    was    in    it    of    the    purely 1220 1219  sensuous    instinct    of    boyhood    had    been    transformed    by    the    workings    of    the    imagination,    changed    into    something 1221 1220  that    seemed    to    the    lad    himself    to    be    remote    from    sense,    and    was    for    that    very    reason    all    the    more    dangerous.    It 1222 1221  was    the    passions    about    whose    origin    we    deceived    ourselves    that    tyrannized    most    strongly    over    us.    Our    weakest 1223 1222  motives    were    those    of    whose    nature    we    were    conscious.    It    often    happened    that    when    we    thought    we    were 1224 1223  experimenting    on    others    we    were    really    experimenting    on    ourselves. 1225 1224  While    Lord    Henry    sat    dreaming    on    these    things,    a    knock    came    to    the    door,    and    his    valet    entered    and 1226 1225  reminded    him    it    was    time    to    dress    for    dinner.    He    got    up    and    looked    out    into    the    street.    The    sunset    had    smitten 1227 1226  into    scarlet    gold    the    upper    windows    of    the    houses    opposite.    The    panes    glowed    like    plates    of    heated    metal.    The 1228 1227  sky    above    was    like    a    faded    rose.    He    thought    of    his    friend’s    young    ﬁery-coloured    life    and    wondered    how    it    was    all 1229 1228  going    to    end. 1230 1229  When    he    arrived    home,    about    half-past    twelve    o’clock,    he    saw    a    telegram    lying    on    the    hall    table.    He    opened    it 1231 1230  and    found    it    was    from    Dorian    Gray.    It    was    to    tell    him    that    he    was    engaged    to    be    married    to    Sibyl    Vane. 1232 1231  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                            CHAPTER    V. 1233 1232  “Mother,    Mother,    I    am    so    happy!”    whispered    the    girl,    burying    her    face    in    the    lap    of    the    faded,    tired-looking 1234 1233  woman    who,    with    back    turned    to    the    shrill    intrusive    light,    was    sitting    in    the    one    arm-chair    that    their    dingy    sitting- 1235 1234  room    contained.    “I    am    so    happy!”    she    repeated,    “and    you    must    be    happy,    too!” 1236 1235  Mrs.    Vane    winced    and    put    her    thin,    bismuth-whitened    hands    on    her    daughter’s    head.    “Happy!”    she    echoed,    “I 1237 1236  am    only    happy,    Sibyl,    when    I    see    you    act.    You    must    not    think    of    anything    but    your    acting.    Mr.    Isaacs    has    been 1238 1237  very    good    to    us,    and    we    owe    him    money.” 1239 1238  The    girl    looked    up    and    pouted.    “Money,    Mother?”    she    cried,    “what    does    money    matter?    Love    is    more    than 1240 1239  money.” 1241 1240  “Mr.    Isaacs    has    advanced    us    ﬁfty    pounds    to    pay    oﬀ    our    debts    and    to    get    a    proper    outﬁt    for    James.    You    must 1242 1241  not    forget    that,    Sibyl.    Fifty    pounds    is    a    very    large    sum.    Mr.    Isaacs    has    been    most    considerate.” 1243 1242  “He    is    not    a    gentleman,    Mother,    and    I    hate    the    way    he    talks    to    me,”    said    the    girl,    rising    to    her    feet    and    going 1244 1243  over    to    the    window. 1245 1244  “I    don’t    know    how    we    could    manage    without    him,”    answered    the    elder    woman    querulously. 1246 1245  Sibyl    Vane    tossed    her    head    and    laughed.    “We    don’t    want    him    any    more,    Mother.    Prince    Charming    rules    life 1247 1246  for    us    now.”    Then    she    paused.    A    rose    shook    in    her    blood    and    shadowed    her    cheeks.    Quick    breath    parted    the 1248 1247  petals    of    her    lips.    They    trembled.    Some    southern    wind    of    passion    swept    over    her    and    stirred    the    dainty    folds    of 1249 1248  her    dress.    “I    love    him,”    she    said    simply. 1250 1249  “Foolish    child!    foolish    child!”    was    the    parrot-phrase    ﬂung    in    answer.    The    waving    of    crooked,    false-jewelled 1251 1250  fingers    gave    grotesqueness    to    the    words. 1252 1251  The    girl    laughed    again.    The    joy    of    a    caged    bird    was    in    her    voice.    Her    eyes    caught    the    melody    and    echoed    it    in 1253 1252  radiance,    then    closed    for    a    moment,    as    though    to    hide    their    secret.    When    they    opened,    the    mist    of    a    dream    had 1254 1253  passed    across    them. 1255 1254  Thin-lipped    wisdom    spoke    at    her    from    the    worn    chair,    hinted    at    prudence,    quoted    from    that    book    of    cowardice 1256 1255  whose    author    apes    the    name    of    common    sense.    She    did    not    listen.    She    was    free    in    her    prison    of    passion.    Her 1257 1256  prince,    Prince    Charming,    was    with    her.    She    had    called    on    memory    to    remake    him.    She    had    sent    her    soul    to 1258 1257  search    for    him,    and    it    had    brought    him    back.    His    kiss    burned    again    upon    her    mouth.    Her    eyelids    were    warm    with 1259 1258  his    breath. 1260 1259  Then    wisdom    altered    its    method    and    spoke    of    espial    and    discovery.    This    young    man    might    be    rich.    If    so, 1261 1260  marriage    should    be    thought    of.    Against    the    shell    of    her    ear    broke    the    waves    of    worldly    cunning.    The    arrows    of 1262 1261  craft    shot    by    her.    She    saw    the    thin    lips    moving,    and    smiled. 1263 1262  Suddenly    she    felt    the    need    to    speak.    The    wordy    silence    troubled    her.    “Mother,    Mother,”    she    cried,    “why    does 1264 1263  he    love    me    so    much?    I    know    why    I    love    him.    I    love    him    because    he    is    like    what    love    himself    should    be.    But    what 1265 1264  does    he    see    in    me?    I    am    not    worthy    of    him.    And    yet—why,    I    cannot    tell—though    I    feel    so    much    beneath    him,    I 1266 1265  don’t    feel    humble.    I    feel    proud,    terribly    proud.    Mother,    did    you    love    my    father    as    I    love    Prince    Charming?” 1267 1266  The    elder    woman    grew    pale    beneath    the    coarse    powder    that    daubed    her    cheeks,    and    her    dry    lips    twitched 1268 1267  with    a    spasm    of    pain.    Sybil    rushed    to    her,    ﬂung    her    arms    round    her    neck,    and    kissed    her.    “Forgive    me,    Mother.    I 1269 1268  know    it    pains    you    to    talk    about    our    father.    But    it    only    pains    you    because    you    loved    him    so    much.    Don’t    look    so 1270 1269  sad.    I    am    as    happy    to-day    as    you    were    twenty    years    ago.    Ah!    let    me    be    happy    for    ever!” 1271 1270  “My    child,    you    are    far    too    young    to    think    of    falling    in    love.    Besides,    what    do    you    know    of    this    young    man?    You 1272 1271  don’t    even    know    his    name.    The    whole    thing    is    most    inconvenient,    and    really,    when    James    is    going    away    to 1273 1272  Australia,    and    I    have    so    much    to    think    of,    I    must    say    that    you    should    have    shown    more    consideration.    However, 1274 1273  as    I    said    before,    if    he    is    rich    ...” 1275 1274  “Ah!    Mother,    Mother,    let    me    be    happy!” 1276 1275  Mrs.    Vane    glanced    at    her,    and    with    one    of    those    false    theatrical    gestures    that    so    often    become    a    mode    of 1277 1276  second    nature    to    a    stage-player,    clasped    her    in    her    arms.    At    this    moment,    the    door    opened    and    a    young    lad 1278 1277  with    rough    brown    hair    came    into    the    room.    He    was    thick-set    of    ﬁgure,    and    his    hands    and    feet    were    large    and 1279 1278  somewhat    clumsy    in    movement.    He    was    not    so    ﬁnely    bred    as    his    sister.    One    would    hardly    have    guessed    the 1280 1279  close    relationship    that    existed    between    them.    Mrs.    Vane    ﬁxed    her    eyes    on    him    and    intensiﬁed    her    smile.    She 1281 1280  mentally    elevated    her    son    to    the    dignity    of    an    audience.    She    felt    sure    that    the    tableau    was    interesting. 1282 1281  “You    might    keep    some    of    your    kisses    for    me,    Sibyl,    I    think,”    said    the    lad    with    a    good-natured    grumble. 1283 1282  “Ah!    but    you    don’t    like    being    kissed,    Jim,”    she    cried.    “You    are    a    dreadful    old    bear.”    And    she    ran    across    the 1284 1283  room    and    hugged    him. 1285 1284  James    Vane    looked    into    his    sister’s    face    with    tenderness.    “I    want    you    to    come    out    with    me    for    a    walk,    Sibyl.    I 1286 1285  don’t    suppose    I    shall    ever    see    this    horrid    London    again.    I    am    sure    I    don’t    want    to.” 1287 1286  “My    son,    don’t    say    such    dreadful    things,”    murmured    Mrs.    Vane,    taking    up    a    tawdry    theatrical    dress,    with    a 1288 1287  sigh,    and    beginning    to    patch    it.    She    felt    a    little    disappointed    that    he    had    not    joined    the    group.    It    would    have 1289 1288  increased    the    theatrical    picturesqueness    of    the    situation. 1290 1289  “Why    not,    Mother?    I    mean    it.” 1291 1290  “You    pain    me,    my    son.    I    trust    you    will    return    from    Australia    in    a    position    of    aﬄuence.    I    believe    there    is    no 1292 1291  society    of    any    kind    in    the    Colonies—nothing    that    I    would    call    society—so    when    you    have    made    your    fortune,    you 1293 1292  must    come    back    and    assert    yourself    in    London.” 1294 1293  “Society!”    muttered    the    lad.    “I    don’t    want    to    know    anything    about    that.    I    should    like    to    make    some    money    to 1295 1294  take    you    and    Sibyl    off    the    stage.    I    hate    it.” 1296 1295  “Oh,    Jim!”    said    Sibyl,    laughing,    “how    unkind    of    you!    But    are    you    really    going    for    a    walk    with    me?    That    will    be 1297 1296  nice!    I    was    afraid    you    were    going    to    say    good-bye    to    some    of    your    friends—to    Tom    Hardy,    who    gave    you    that 1298 1297  \\x0chideous    pipe,    or    Ned    Langton,    who    makes    fun    of    you    for    smoking    it.    It    is    very    sweet    of    you    to    let    me    have    your 1299 1298  last    afternoon.    Where    shall    we    go?    Let    us    go    to    the    park.” 1300 1299  “I    am    too    shabby,”    he    answered,    frowning.    “Only    swell    people    go    to    the    park.” 1301 1300  “Nonsense,    Jim,”    she    whispered,    stroking    the    sleeve    of    his    coat. 1302 1301  He    hesitated    for    a    moment.    “Very    well,”    he    said    at    last,    “but    don’t    be    too    long    dressing.”    She    danced    out    of    the 1303 1302  door.    One    could    hear    her    singing    as    she    ran    upstairs.    Her    little    feet    pattered    overhead. 1304 1303  He    walked    up    and    down    the    room    two    or    three    times.    Then    he    turned    to    the    still    ﬁgure    in    the    chair.    “Mother, 1305 1304  are    my    things    ready?”    he    asked. 1306 1305  “Quite    ready,    James,”    she    answered,    keeping    her    eyes    on    her    work.    For    some    months    past    she    had    felt    ill    at 1307 1306  ease    when    she    was    alone    with    this    rough    stern    son    of    hers.    Her    shallow    secret    nature    was    troubled    when    their 1308 1307  eyes    met.    She    used    to    wonder    if    he    suspected    anything.    The    silence,    for    he    made    no    other    observation,    became 1309 1308  intolerable    to    her.    She    began    to    complain.    Women    defend    themselves    by    attacking,    just    as    they    attack    by 1310 1309  sudden    and    strange    surrenders.    “I    hope    you    will    be    contented,    James,    with    your    sea-faring    life,”    she    said.    “You 1311 1310  must    remember    that    it    is    your    own    choice.    You    might    have    entered    a    solicitor’s    oﬃce.    Solicitors    are    a    very 1312 1311  respectable    class,    and    in    the    country    often    dine    with    the    best    families.” 1313 1312  “I    hate    oﬃces,    and    I    hate    clerks,”    he    replied.    “But    you    are    quite    right.    I    have    chosen    my    own    life.    All    I    say    is, 1314 1313  watch    over    Sibyl.    Don’t    let    her    come    to    any    harm.    Mother,    you    must    watch    over    her.” 1315 1314  “James,    you    really    talk    very    strangely.    Of    course    I    watch    over    Sibyl.” 1316 1315  “I    hear    a    gentleman    comes    every    night    to    the    theatre    and    goes    behind    to    talk    to    her.    Is    that    right?    What    about 1317 1316  that?” 1318 1317  “You    are    speaking    about    things    you    don’t    understand,    James.    In    the    profession    we    are    accustomed    to    receive 1319 1318  a    great    deal    of    most    gratifying    attention.    I    myself    used    to    receive    many    bouquets    at    one    time.    That    was    when 1320 1319  acting    was    really    understood.    As    for    Sibyl,    I    do    not    know    at    present    whether    her    attachment    is    serious    or    not. 1321 1320  But    there    is    no    doubt    that    the    young    man    in    question    is    a    perfect    gentleman.    He    is    always    most    polite    to    me. 1322 1321  Besides,    he    has    the    appearance    of    being    rich,    and    the    flowers    he    sends    are    lovely.” 1323 1322  “You    don’t    know    his    name,    though,”    said    the    lad    harshly. 1324 1323  “No,”    answered    his    mother    with    a    placid    expression    in    her    face.    “He    has    not    yet    revealed    his    real    name.    I 1325 1324  think    it    is    quite    romantic    of    him.    He    is    probably    a    member    of    the    aristocracy.” 1326 1325  James    Vane    bit    his    lip.    “Watch    over    Sibyl,    Mother,”    he    cried,    “watch    over    her.” 1327 1326  “My    son,    you    distress    me    very    much.    Sibyl    is    always    under    my    special    care.    Of    course,    if    this    gentleman    is 1328 1327  wealthy,    there    is    no    reason    why    she    should    not    contract    an    alliance    with    him.    I    trust    he    is    one    of    the    aristocracy. 1329 1328  He    has    all    the    appearance    of    it,    I    must    say.    It    might    be    a    most    brilliant    marriage    for    Sibyl.    They    would    make    a 1330 1329  charming    couple.    His    good    looks    are    really    quite    remarkable;    everybody    notices    them.” 1331 1330  The    lad    muttered    something    to    himself    and    drummed    on    the    window-pane    with    his    coarse    ﬁngers.    He    had    just 1332 1331  turned    round    to    say    something    when    the    door    opened    and    Sibyl    ran    in. 1333 1332  “How    serious    you    both    are!”    she    cried.    “What    is    the    matter?” 1334 1333  “Nothing,”    he    answered.    “I    suppose    one    must    be    serious    sometimes.    Good-bye,    Mother;    I    will    have    my    dinner 1335 1334  at    five    o’clock.    Everything    is    packed,    except    my    shirts,    so    you    need    not    trouble.” 1336 1335  “Good-bye,    my    son,”    she    answered    with    a    bow    of    strained    stateliness. 1337 1336  She    was    extremely    annoyed    at    the    tone    he    had    adopted    with    her,    and    there    was    something    in    his    look    that 1338 1337  had    made    her    feel    afraid. 1339 1338  “Kiss    me,    Mother,”    said    the    girl.    Her    flowerlike    lips    touched    the    withered    cheek    and    warmed    its    frost. 1340 1339  “My    child!    my    child!”    cried    Mrs.    Vane,    looking    up    to    the    ceiling    in    search    of    an    imaginary    gallery. 1341 1340  “Come,    Sibyl,”    said    her    brother    impatiently.    He    hated    his    mother’s    affectations. 1342 1341  They    went    out    into    the    ﬂickering,    wind-blown    sunlight    and    strolled    down    the    dreary    Euston    Road.    The 1343 1342  passersby    glanced    in    wonder    at    the    sullen    heavy    youth    who,    in    coarse,    ill-ﬁtting    clothes,    was    in    the    company    of 1344 1343  such    a    graceful,    refined-looking    girl.    He    was    like    a    common    gardener    walking    with    a    rose. 1345 1344  Jim    frowned    from    time    to    time    when    he    caught    the    inquisitive    glance    of    some    stranger.    He    had    that    dislike    of 1346 1345  being    stared    at,    which    comes    on    geniuses    late    in    life    and    never    leaves    the    commonplace.    Sibyl,    however,    was 1347 1346  quite    unconscious    of    the    eﬀect    she    was    producing.    Her    love    was    trembling    in    laughter    on    her    lips.    She    was 1348 1347  thinking    of    Prince    Charming,    and,    that    she    might    think    of    him    all    the    more,    she    did    not    talk    of    him,    but    prattled    on 1349 1348  about    the    ship    in    which    Jim    was    going    to    sail,    about    the    gold    he    was    certain    to    ﬁnd,    about    the    wonderful    heiress 1350 1349  whose    life    he    was    to    save    from    the    wicked,    red-shirted    bushrangers.    For    he    was    not    to    remain    a    sailor,    or    a 1351 1350  supercargo,    or    whatever    he    was    going    to    be.    Oh,    no!    A    sailor’s    existence    was    dreadful.    Fancy    being    cooped    up 1352 1351  in    a    horrid    ship,    with    the    hoarse,    hump-backed    waves    trying    to    get    in,    and    a    black    wind    blowing    the    masts    down 1353 1352  and    tearing    the    sails    into    long    screaming    ribands!    He    was    to    leave    the    vessel    at    Melbourne,    bid    a    polite    good- 1354 1353  bye    to    the    captain,    and    go    oﬀ    at    once    to    the    gold-ﬁelds.    Before    a    week    was    over    he    was    to    come    across    a    large 1355 1354  nugget    of    pure    gold,    the    largest    nugget    that    had    ever    been    discovered,    and    bring    it    down    to    the    coast    in    a 1356 1355  waggon    guarded    by    six    mounted    policemen.    The    bushrangers    were    to    attack    them    three    times,    and    be    defeated 1357 1356  with    immense    slaughter.    Or,    no.    He    was    not    to    go    to    the    gold-ﬁelds    at    all.    They    were    horrid    places,    where    men 1358 1357  got    intoxicated,    and    shot    each    other    in    bar-rooms,    and    used    bad    language.    He    was    to    be    a    nice    sheep-farmer, 1359 1358  and    one    evening,    as    he    was    riding    home,    he    was    to    see    the    beautiful    heiress    being    carried    oﬀ    by    a    robber    on    a 1360 1359  black    horse,    and    give    chase,    and    rescue    her.    Of    course,    she    would    fall    in    love    with    him,    and    he    with    her,    and 1361 1360  they    would    get    married,    and    come    home,    and    live    in    an    immense    house    in    London.    Yes,    there    were    delightful 1362 1361  things    in    store    for    him.    But    he    must    be    very    good,    and    not    lose    his    temper,    or    spend    his    money    foolishly.    She 1363 1362  was    only    a    year    older    than    he    was,    but    she    knew    so    much    more    of    life.    He    must    be    sure,    also,    to    write    to    her    by 1364 1363  every    mail,    and    to    say    his    prayers    each    night    before    he    went    to    sleep.    God    was    very    good,    and    would    watch 1365 1364  over    him.    She    would    pray    for    him,    too,    and    in    a    few    years    he    would    come    back    quite    rich    and    happy. 1366 1365  \\x0c            The    lad    listened    sulkily    to    her    and    made    no    answer.    He    was    heart-sick    at    leaving    home. 1367 1366  Yet    it    was    not    this    alone    that    made    him    gloomy    and    morose.    Inexperienced    though    he    was,    he    had    still    a 1368 1367  strong    sense    of    the    danger    of    Sibyl’s    position.    This    young    dandy    who    was    making    love    to    her    could    mean    her 1369 1368  no    good.    He    was    a    gentleman,    and    he    hated    him    for    that,    hated    him    through    some    curious    race-instinct    for 1370 1369  which    he    could    not    account,    and    which    for    that    reason    was    all    the    more    dominant    within    him.    He    was    conscious 1371 1370  also    of    the    shallowness    and    vanity    of    his    mother’s    nature,    and    in    that    saw    inﬁnite    peril    for    Sibyl    and    Sibyl’s 1372 1371  happiness.    Children    begin    by    loving    their    parents;    as    they    grow    older    they    judge    them;    sometimes    they    forgive 1373 1372  them. 1374 1373  His    mother!    He    had    something    on    his    mind    to    ask    of    her,    something    that    he    had    brooded    on    for    many    months 1375 1374  of    silence.    A    chance    phrase    that    he    had    heard    at    the    theatre,    a    whispered    sneer    that    had    reached    his    ears    one 1376 1375  night    as    he    waited    at    the    stage-door,    had    set    loose    a    train    of    horrible    thoughts.    He    remembered    it    as    if    it    had 1377 1376  been    the    lash    of    a    hunting-crop    across    his    face.    His    brows    knit    together    into    a    wedge-like    furrow,    and    with    a 1378 1377  twitch    of    pain    he    bit    his    underlip. 1379 1378  “You    are    not    listening    to    a    word    I    am    saying,    Jim,”    cried    Sibyl,    “and    I    am    making    the    most    delightful    plans    for 1380 1379  your    future.    Do    say    something.” 1381 1380  “What    do    you    want    me    to    say?” 1382 1381  “Oh!    that    you    will    be    a    good    boy    and    not    forget    us,”    she    answered,    smiling    at    him. 1383 1382  He    shrugged    his    shoulders.    “You    are    more    likely    to    forget    me    than    I    am    to    forget    you,    Sibyl.” 1384 1383  She    flushed.    “What    do    you    mean,    Jim?”    she    asked. 1385 1384  “You    have    a    new    friend,    I    hear.    Who    is    he?    Why    have    you    not    told    me    about    him?    He    means    you    no    good.” 1386 1385  “Stop,    Jim!”    she    exclaimed.    “You    must    not    say    anything    against    him.    I    love    him.” 1387 1386  “Why,    you    don’t    even    know    his    name,”    answered    the    lad.    “Who    is    he?    I    have    a    right    to    know.” 1388 1387  “He    is    called    Prince    Charming.    Don’t    you    like    the    name?    Oh!    you    silly    boy!    you    should    never    forget    it.    If    you 1389 1388  only    saw    him,    you    would    think    him    the    most    wonderful    person    in    the    world.    Some    day    you    will    meet    him—when 1390 1389  you    come    back    from    Australia.    You    will    like    him    so    much.    Everybody    likes    him,    and    I    ...    love    him.    I    wish    you 1391 1390  could    come    to    the    theatre    to-night.    He    is    going    to    be    there,    and    I    am    to    play    Juliet.    Oh!    how    I    shall    play    it!    Fancy, 1392 1391  Jim,    to    be    in    love    and    play    Juliet!    To    have    him    sitting    there!    To    play    for    his    delight!    I    am    afraid    I    may    frighten    th 1393 1392  company,    frighten    or    enthrall    them.    To    be    in    love    is    to    surpass    one’s    self.    Poor    dreadful    Mr.    Isaacs    will    be 1394 1393  shouting    ‘genius’    to    his    loafers    at    the    bar.    He    has    preached    me    as    a    dogma;    to-night    he    will    announce    me    as    a 1395 1394  revelation.    I    feel    it.    And    it    is    all    his,    his    only,    Prince    Charming,    my    wonderful    lover,    my    god    of    graces.    But    I    am 1396 1395  poor    beside    him.    Poor?    What    does    that    matter?    When    poverty    creeps    in    at    the    door,    love    ﬂies    in    through    the 1397 1396  window.    Our    proverbs    want    rewriting.    They    were    made    in    winter,    and    it    is    summer    now;    spring-time    for    me,    I 1398 1397  think,    a    very    dance    of    blossoms    in    blue    skies.” 1399 1398  “He    is    a    gentleman,”    said    the    lad    sullenly. 1400 1399  “A    prince!”    she    cried    musically.    “What    more    do    you    want?” 1401 1400  “He    wants    to    enslave    you.” 1402 1401  “I    shudder    at    the    thought    of    being    free.” 1403 1402  “I    want    you    to    beware    of    him.” 1404 1403  “To    see    him    is    to    worship    him;    to    know    him    is    to    trust    him.” 1405 1404  “Sibyl,    you    are    mad    about    him.” 1406 1405  She    laughed    and    took    his    arm.    “You    dear    old    Jim,    you    talk    as    if    you    were    a    hundred.    Some    day    you    will    be    in 1407 1406  love    yourself.    Then    you    will    know    what    it    is.    Don’t    look    so    sulky.    Surely    you    should    be    glad    to    think    that,    though 1408 1407  you    are    going    away,    you    leave    me    happier    than    I    have    ever    been    before.    Life    has    been    hard    for    us    both,    terribly 1409 1408  hard    and    diﬃcult.    But    it    will    be    diﬀerent    now.    You    are    going    to    a    new    world,    and    I    have    found    one.    Here    are    two 1410 1409  chairs;    let    us    sit    down    and    see    the    smart    people    go    by.” 1411 1410  They    took    their    seats    amidst    a    crowd    of    watchers.    The    tulip-beds    across    the    road    ﬂamed    like    throbbing    rings 1412 1411  of    ﬁre.    A    white    dust—tremulous    cloud    of    orris-root    it    seemed—hung    in    the    panting    air.    The    brightly    coloured 1413 1412  parasols    danced    and    dipped    like    monstrous    butterflies. 1414 1413  She    made    her    brother    talk    of    himself,    his    hopes,    his    prospects.    He    spoke    slowly    and    with    eﬀort.    They    passed 1415 1414  words    to    each    other    as    players    at    a    game    pass    counters.    Sibyl    felt    oppressed.    She    could    not    communicate    her 1416 1415  joy.    A    faint    smile    curving    that    sullen    mouth    was    all    the    echo    she    could    win.    After    some    time    she    became    silent. 1417 1416  Suddenly    she    caught    a    glimpse    of    golden    hair    and    laughing    lips,    and    in    an    open    carriage    with    two    ladies    Dorian 1418 1417  Gray    drove    past. 1419 1418  She    started    to    her    feet.    “There    he    is!”    she    cried. 1420 1419  “Who?”    said    Jim    Vane. 1421 1420  “Prince    Charming,”    she    answered,    looking    after    the    victoria. 1422 1421  He    jumped    up    and    seized    her    roughly    by    the    arm.    “Show    him    to    me.    Which    is    he?    Point    him    out.    I    must    see 1423 1422  him!”    he    exclaimed;    but    at    that    moment    the    Duke    of    Berwick’s    four-in-hand    came    between,    and    when    it    had    left 1424 1423  the    space    clear,    the    carriage    had    swept    out    of    the    park. 1425 1424  “He    is    gone,”    murmured    Sibyl    sadly.    “I    wish    you    had    seen    him.” 1426 1425  “I    wish    I    had,    for    as    sure    as    there    is    a    God    in    heaven,    if    he    ever    does    you    any    wrong,    I    shall    kill    him.” 1427 1426  She    looked    at    him    in    horror.    He    repeated    his    words.    They    cut    the    air    like    a    dagger.    The    people    round    began    to 1428 1427  gape.    A    lady    standing    close    to    her    tittered. 1429 1428  “Come    away,    Jim;    come    away,”    she    whispered.    He    followed    her    doggedly    as    she    passed    through    the    crowd. 1430 1429  He    felt    glad    at    what    he    had    said. 1431 1430  When    they    reached    the    Achilles    Statue,    she    turned    round.    There    was    pity    in    her    eyes    that    became    laughter 1432 1431  on    her    lips.    She    shook    her    head    at    him.    “You    are    foolish,    Jim,    utterly    foolish;    a    bad-tempered    boy,    that    is    all. 1433 1432  \\x0cHow    can    you    say    such    horrible    things?    You    don’t    know    what    you    are    talking    about.    You    are    simply    jealous    and 1434 1433  unkind.    Ah!    I    wish    you    would    fall    in    love.    Love    makes    people    good,    and    what    you    said    was    wicked.” 1435 1434  “I    am    sixteen,”    he    answered,    “and    I    know    what    I    am    about.    Mother    is    no    help    to    you.    She    doesn’t    understand 1436 1435  how    to    look    after    you.    I    wish    now    that    I    was    not    going    to    Australia    at    all.    I    have    a    great    mind    to    chuck    the    whole 1437 1436  thing    up.    I    would,    if    my    articles    hadn’t    been    signed.” 1438 1437  “Oh,    don’t    be    so    serious,    Jim.    You    are    like    one    of    the    heroes    of    those    silly    melodramas    Mother    used    to    be    so 1439 1438  fond    of    acting    in.    I    am    not    going    to    quarrel    with    you.    I    have    seen    him,    and    oh!    to    see    him    is    perfect    happiness. 1440 1439  We    won’t    quarrel.    I    know    you    would    never    harm    any    one    I    love,    would    you?” 1441 1440  “Not    as    long    as    you    love    him,    I    suppose,”    was    the    sullen    answer. 1442 1441  “I    shall    love    him    for    ever!”    she    cried. 1443 1442  “And    he?” 1444 1443  “For    ever,    too!” 1445 1444  “He    had    better.” 1446 1445  She    shrank    from    him.    Then    she    laughed    and    put    her    hand    on    his    arm.    He    was    merely    a    boy. 1447 1446  At    the    Marble    Arch    they    hailed    an    omnibus,    which    left    them    close    to    their    shabby    home    in    the    Euston    Road.    It 1448 1447  was    after    ﬁve    o’clock,    and    Sibyl    had    to    lie    down    for    a    couple    of    hours    before    acting.    Jim    insisted    that    she    should 1449 1448  do    so.    He    said    that    he    would    sooner    part    with    her    when    their    mother    was    not    present.    She    would    be    sure    to 1450 1449  make    a    scene,    and    he    detested    scenes    of    every    kind. 1451 1450  In    Sybil’s    own    room    they    parted.    There    was    jealousy    in    the    lad’s    heart,    and    a    ﬁerce    murderous    hatred    of    the 1452 1451  stranger    who,    as    it    seemed    to    him,    had    come    between    them.    Yet,    when    her    arms    were    ﬂung    round    his    neck, 1453 1452  and    her    ﬁngers    strayed    through    his    hair,    he    softened    and    kissed    her    with    real    aﬀection.    There    were    tears    in    his 1454 1453  eyes    as    he    went    downstairs. 1455 1454  His    mother    was    waiting    for    him    below.    She    grumbled    at    his    unpunctuality,    as    he    entered.    He    made    no    answer, 1456 1455  but    sat    down    to    his    meagre    meal.    The    ﬂies    buzzed    round    the    table    and    crawled    over    the    stained    cloth.    Through 1457 1456  the    rumble    of    omnibuses,    and    the    clatter    of    street-cabs,    he    could    hear    the    droning    voice    devouring    each    minute 1458 1457  that    was    left    to    him. 1459 1458  After    some    time,    he    thrust    away    his    plate    and    put    his    head    in    his    hands.    He    felt    that    he    had    a    right    to    know.    It 1460 1459  should    have    been    told    to    him    before,    if    it    was    as    he    suspected.    Leaden    with    fear,    his    mother    watched    him. 1461 1460  Words    dropped    mechanically    from    her    lips.    A    tattered    lace    handkerchief    twitched    in    her    ﬁngers.    When    the    clock 1462 1461  struck    six,    he    got    up    and    went    to    the    door.    Then    he    turned    back    and    looked    at    her.    Their    eyes    met.    In    hers    he 1463 1462  saw    a    wild    appeal    for    mercy.    It    enraged    him. 1464 1463  “Mother,    I    have    something    to    ask    you,”    he    said.    Her    eyes    wandered    vaguely    about    the    room.    She    made    no 1465 1464  answer.    “Tell    me    the    truth.    I    have    a    right    to    know.    Were    you    married    to    my    father?” 1466 1465  She    heaved    a    deep    sigh.    It    was    a    sigh    of    relief.    The    terrible    moment,    the    moment    that    night    and    day,    for 1467 1466  weeks    and    months,    she    had    dreaded,    had    come    at    last,    and    yet    she    felt    no    terror.    Indeed,    in    some    measure    it 1468 1467  was    a    disappointment    to    her.    The    vulgar    directness    of    the    question    called    for    a    direct    answer.    The    situation    had 1469 1468  not    been    gradually    led    up    to.    It    was    crude.    It    reminded    her    of    a    bad    rehearsal. 1470 1469  “No,”    she    answered,    wondering    at    the    harsh    simplicity    of    life. 1471 1470  “My    father    was    a    scoundrel    then!”    cried    the    lad,    clenching    his    fists. 1472 1471  She    shook    her    head.    “I    knew    he    was    not    free.    We    loved    each    other    very    much.    If    he    had    lived,    he    would    have 1473 1472  made    provision    for    us.    Don’t    speak    against    him,    my    son.    He    was    your    father,    and    a    gentleman.    Indeed,    he    was 1474 1473  highly    connected.” 1475 1474  An    oath    broke    from    his    lips.    “I    don’t    care    for    myself,”    he    exclaimed,    “but    don’t    let    Sibyl....    It    is    a    gentleman,    isn 1476 1475  it,    who    is    in    love    with    her,    or    says    he    is?    Highly    connected,    too,    I    suppose.” 1477 1476  For    a    moment    a    hideous    sense    of    humiliation    came    over    the    woman.    Her    head    drooped.    She    wiped    her    eyes 1478 1477  with    shaking    hands.    “Sibyl    has    a    mother,”    she    murmured;    “I    had    none.” 1479 1478  The    lad    was    touched.    He    went    towards    her,    and    stooping    down,    he    kissed    her.    “I    am    sorry    if    I    have    pained 1480 1479  you    by    asking    about    my    father,”    he    said,    “but    I    could    not    help    it.    I    must    go    now.    Good-bye.    Don’t    forget    that    you 1481 1480  will    have    only    one    child    now    to    look    after,    and    believe    me    that    if    this    man    wrongs    my    sister,    I    will    ﬁnd    out    who    he 1482 1481  is,    track    him    down,    and    kill    him    like    a    dog.    I    swear    it.” 1483 1482  The    exaggerated    folly    of    the    threat,    the    passionate    gesture    that    accompanied    it,    the    mad    melodramatic 1484 1483  words,    made    life    seem    more    vivid    to    her.    She    was    familiar    with    the    atmosphere.    She    breathed    more    freely,    and 1485 1484  for    the    ﬁrst    time    for    many    months    she    really    admired    her    son.    She    would    have    liked    to    have    continued    the    scene 1486 1485  on    the    same    emotional    scale,    but    he    cut    her    short.    Trunks    had    to    be    carried    down    and    muﬄers    looked    for.    The 1487 1486  lodging-house    drudge    bustled    in    and    out.    There    was    the    bargaining    with    the    cabman.    The    moment    was    lost    in 1488 1487  vulgar    details.    It    was    with    a    renewed    feeling    of    disappointment    that    she    waved    the    tattered    lace    handkerchief 1489 1488  from    the    window,    as    her    son    drove    away.    She    was    conscious    that    a    great    opportunity    had    been    wasted.    She 1490 1489  consoled    herself    by    telling    Sibyl    how    desolate    she    felt    her    life    would    be,    now    that    she    had    only    one    child    to    look 1491 1490  after.    She    remembered    the    phrase.    It    had    pleased    her.    Of    the    threat    she    said    nothing.    It    was    vividly    and 1492 1491  dramatically    expressed.    She    felt    that    they    would    all    laugh    at    it    some    day. 1493 1492  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                            CHAPTER    VI. 1494 1493  “I    suppose    you    have    heard    the    news,    Basil?”    said    Lord    Henry    that    evening    as    Hallward    was    shown    into    a    little 1495 1494  private    room    at    the    Bristol    where    dinner    had    been    laid    for    three. 1496 1495  “No,    Harry,”    answered    the    artist,    giving    his    hat    and    coat    to    the    bowing    waiter.    “What    is    it?    Nothing    about 1497 1496  politics,    I    hope!    They    don’t    interest    me.    There    is    hardly    a    single    person    in    the    House    of    Commons    worth 1498 1497  painting,    though    many    of    them    would    be    the    better    for    a    little    whitewashing.” 1499 1498  “Dorian    Gray    is    engaged    to    be    married,”    said    Lord    Henry,    watching    him    as    he    spoke. 1500 1499  Hallward    started    and    then    frowned.    “Dorian    engaged    to    be    married!”    he    cried.    “Impossible!” 1501 1500  “It    is    perfectly    true.” 1502 1501  “To    whom?” 1503 1502  “To    some    little    actress    or    other.” 1504 1503  “I    can’t    believe    it.    Dorian    is    far    too    sensible.” 1505 1504  “Dorian    is    far    too    wise    not    to    do    foolish    things    now    and    then,    my    dear    Basil.” 1506 1505  “Marriage    is    hardly    a    thing    that    one    can    do    now    and    then,    Harry.” 1507 1506  “Except    in    America,”    rejoined    Lord    Henry    languidly.    “But    I    didn’t    say    he    was    married.    I    said    he    was    engaged    to 1508 1507  be    married.    There    is    a    great    diﬀerence.    I    have    a    distinct    remembrance    of    being    married,    but    I    have    no 1509 1508  recollection    at    all    of    being    engaged.    I    am    inclined    to    think    that    I    never    was    engaged.” 1510 1509  “But    think    of    Dorian’s    birth,    and    position,    and    wealth.    It    would    be    absurd    for    him    to    marry    so    much    beneath 1511 1510  him.” 1512 1511  “If    you    want    to    make    him    marry    this    girl,    tell    him    that,    Basil.    He    is    sure    to    do    it,    then.    Whenever    a    man    does    a 1513 1512  thoroughly    stupid    thing,    it    is    always    from    the    noblest    motives.” 1514 1513  “I    hope    the    girl    is    good,    Harry.    I    don’t    want    to    see    Dorian    tied    to    some    vile    creature,    who    might    degrade    his 1515 1514  nature    and    ruin    his    intellect.” 1516 1515  “Oh,    she    is    better    than    good—she    is    beautiful,”    murmured    Lord    Henry,    sipping    a    glass    of    vermouth    and 1517 1516  orange-bitters.    “Dorian    says    she    is    beautiful,    and    he    is    not    often    wrong    about    things    of    that    kind.    Your    portrait    of 1518 1517  him    has    quickened    his    appreciation    of    the    personal    appearance    of    other    people.    It    has    had    that    excellent    eﬀect, 1519 1518  amongst    others.    We    are    to    see    her    to-night,    if    that    boy    doesn’t    forget    his    appointment.” 1520 1519  “Are    you    serious?” 1521 1520  “Quite    serious,    Basil.    I    should    be    miserable    if    I    thought    I    should    ever    be    more    serious    than    I    am    at    the    present 1522 1521  moment.” 1523 1522  “But    do    you    approve    of    it,    Harry?”    asked    the    painter,    walking    up    and    down    the    room    and    biting    his    lip.    “You 1524 1523  can’t    approve    of    it,    possibly.    It    is    some    silly    infatuation.” 1525 1524  “I    never    approve,    or    disapprove,    of    anything    now.    It    is    an    absurd    attitude    to    take    towards    life.    We    are    not    sent 1526 1525  into    the    world    to    air    our    moral    prejudices.    I    never    take    any    notice    of    what    common    people    say,    and    I    never 1527 1526  interfere    with    what    charming    people    do.    If    a    personality    fascinates    me,    whatever    mode    of    expression    that 1528 1527  personality    selects    is    absolutely    delightful    to    me.    Dorian    Gray    falls    in    love    with    a    beautiful    girl    who    acts    Juliet, 1529 1528  and    proposes    to    marry    her.    Why    not?    If    he    wedded    Messalina,    he    would    be    none    the    less    interesting.    You    know 1530 1529  I    am    not    a    champion    of    marriage.    The    real    drawback    to    marriage    is    that    it    makes    one    unselﬁsh.    And    unselﬁsh 1531 1530  people    are    colourless.    They    lack    individuality.    Still,    there    are    certain    temperaments    that    marriage    makes    more 1532 1531  complex.    They    retain    their    egotism,    and    add    to    it    many    other    egos.    They    are    forced    to    have    more    than    one    life. 1533 1532  They    become    more    highly    organized,    and    to    be    highly    organized    is,    I    should    fancy,    the    object    of    man’s 1534 1533  existence.    Besides,    every    experience    is    of    value,    and    whatever    one    may    say    against    marriage,    it    is    certainly    an 1535 1534  experience.    I    hope    that    Dorian    Gray    will    make    this    girl    his    wife,    passionately    adore    her    for    six    months,    and    then 1536 1535  suddenly    become    fascinated    by    some    one    else.    He    would    be    a    wonderful    study.” 1537 1536  “You    don’t    mean    a    single    word    of    all    that,    Harry;    you    know    you    don’t.    If    Dorian    Gray’s    life    were    spoiled,    no    one 1538 1537  would    be    sorrier    than    yourself.    You    are    much    better    than    you    pretend    to    be.” 1539 1538  Lord    Henry    laughed.    “The    reason    we    all    like    to    think    so    well    of    others    is    that    we    are    all    afraid    for    ourselves. 1540 1539  The    basis    of    optimism    is    sheer    terror.    We    think    that    we    are    generous    because    we    credit    our    neighbour    with    the 1541 1540  possession    of    those    virtues    that    are    likely    to    be    a    beneﬁt    to    us.    We    praise    the    banker    that    we    may    overdraw    our 1542 1541  account,    and    ﬁnd    good    qualities    in    the    highwayman    in    the    hope    that    he    may    spare    our    pockets.    I    mean 1543 1542  everything    that    I    have    said.    I    have    the    greatest    contempt    for    optimism.    As    for    a    spoiled    life,    no    life    is    spoiled    but 1544 1543  one    whose    growth    is    arrested.    If    you    want    to    mar    a    nature,    you    have    merely    to    reform    it.    As    for    marriage,    of 1545 1544  course    that    would    be    silly,    but    there    are    other    and    more    interesting    bonds    between    men    and    women.    I    will 1546 1545  certainly    encourage    them.    They    have    the    charm    of    being    fashionable.    But    here    is    Dorian    himself.    He    will    tell    you 1547 1546  more    than    I    can.” 1548 1547  “My    dear    Harry,    my    dear    Basil,    you    must    both    congratulate    me!”    said    the    lad,    throwing    oﬀ    his    evening    cape 1549 1548  with    its    satin-lined    wings    and    shaking    each    of    his    friends    by    the    hand    in    turn.    “I    have    never    been    so    happy.    Of 1550 1549  course,    it    is    sudden—all    really    delightful    things    are.    And    yet    it    seems    to    me    to    be    the    one    thing    I    have    been 1551 1550  looking    for    all    my    life.”    He    was    flushed    with    excitement    and    pleasure,    and    looked    extraordinarily    handsome. 1552 1551  “I    hope    you    will    always    be    very    happy,    Dorian,”    said    Hallward,    “but    I    don’t    quite    forgive    you    for    not    having    let 1553 1552  me    know    of    your    engagement.    You    let    Harry    know.” 1554 1553  “And    I    don’t    forgive    you    for    being    late    for    dinner,”    broke    in    Lord    Henry,    putting    his    hand    on    the    lad’s    shoulder 1555 1554  and    smiling    as    he    spoke.    “Come,    let    us    sit    down    and    try    what    the    new    chef    here    is    like,    and    then    you    will    tell    us 1556 1555  how    it    all    came    about.” 1557 1556  “There    is    really    not    much    to    tell,”    cried    Dorian    as    they    took    their    seats    at    the    small    round    table.    “What 1558 1557  happened    was    simply    this.    After    I    left    you    yesterday    evening,    Harry,    I    dressed,    had    some    dinner    at    that    little 1559 1558  \\x0cItalian    restaurant    in    Rupert    Street    you    introduced    me    to,    and    went    down    at    eight    o’clock    to    the    theatre.    Sibyl    was 1560 1559  playing    Rosalind.    Of    course,    the    scenery    was    dreadful    and    the    Orlando    absurd.    But    Sibyl!    You    should    have 1561 1560  seen    her!    When    she    came    on    in    her    boy’s    clothes,    she    was    perfectly    wonderful.    She    wore    a    moss-coloured 1562 1561  velvet    jerkin    with    cinnamon    sleeves,    slim,    brown,    cross-gartered    hose,    a    dainty    little    green    cap    with    a    hawk’s 1563 1562  feather    caught    in    a    jewel,    and    a    hooded    cloak    lined    with    dull    red.    She    had    never    seemed    to    me    more    exquisite. 1564 1563  She    had    all    the    delicate    grace    of    that    Tanagra    ﬁgurine    that    you    have    in    your    studio,    Basil.    Her    hair    clustered 1565 1564  round    her    face    like    dark    leaves    round    a    pale    rose.    As    for    her    acting—well,    you    shall    see    her    to-night.    She    is 1566 1565  simply    a    born    artist.    I    sat    in    the    dingy    box    absolutely    enthralled.    I    forgot    that    I    was    in    London    and    in    the 1567 1566  nineteenth    century.    I    was    away    with    my    love    in    a    forest    that    no    man    had    ever    seen.    After    the    performance    was 1568 1567  over,    I    went    behind    and    spoke    to    her.    As    we    were    sitting    together,    suddenly    there    came    into    her    eyes    a    look    that 1569 1568  I    had    never    seen    there    before.    My    lips    moved    towards    hers.    We    kissed    each    other.    I    can’t    describe    to    you    what    I 1570 1569  felt    at    that    moment.    It    seemed    to    me    that    all    my    life    had    been    narrowed    to    one    perfect    point    of    rose-coloured    joy. 1571 1570  She    trembled    all    over    and    shook    like    a    white    narcissus.    Then    she    ﬂung    herself    on    her    knees    and    kissed    my 1572 1571  hands.    I    feel    that    I    should    not    tell    you    all    this,    but    I    can’t    help    it.    Of    course,    our    engagement    is    a    dead    secret. 1573 1572  She    has    not    even    told    her    own    mother.    I    don’t    know    what    my    guardians    will    say.    Lord    Radley    is    sure    to    be 1574 1573  furious.    I    don’t    care.    I    shall    be    of    age    in    less    than    a    year,    and    then    I    can    do    what    I    like.    I    have    been    right,    Bas 1575 1574  haven’t    I,    to    take    my    love    out    of    poetry    and    to    ﬁnd    my    wife    in    Shakespeare’s    plays?    Lips    that    Shakespeare 1576 1575  taught    to    speak    have    whispered    their    secret    in    my    ear.    I    have    had    the    arms    of    Rosalind    around    me,    and    kissed 1577 1576  Juliet    on    the    mouth.” 1578 1577  “Yes,    Dorian,    I    suppose    you    were    right,”    said    Hallward    slowly. 1579 1578  “Have    you    seen    her    to-day?”    asked    Lord    Henry. 1580 1579  Dorian    Gray    shook    his    head.    “I    left    her    in    the    forest    of    Arden;    I    shall    find    her    in    an    orchard    in    Verona.” 1581 1580  Lord    Henry    sipped    his    champagne    in    a    meditative    manner.    “At    what    particular    point    did    you    mention    the    word 1582 1581  marriage,    Dorian?    And    what    did    she    say    in    answer?    Perhaps    you    forgot    all    about    it.” 1583 1582  “My    dear    Harry,    I    did    not    treat    it    as    a    business    transaction,    and    I    did    not    make    any    formal    proposal.    I    told    her 1584 1583  that    I    loved    her,    and    she    said    she    was    not    worthy    to    be    my    wife.    Not    worthy!    Why,    the    whole    world    is    nothing    to 1585 1584  me    compared    with    her.” 1586 1585  “Women    are    wonderfully    practical,”    murmured    Lord    Henry,    “much    more    practical    than    we    are.    In    situations    of 1587 1586  that    kind    we    often    forget    to    say    anything    about    marriage,    and    they    always    remind    us.” 1588 1587  Hallward    laid    his    hand    upon    his    arm.    “Don’t,    Harry.    You    have    annoyed    Dorian.    He    is    not    like    other    men.    He 1589 1588  would    never    bring    misery    upon    any    one.    His    nature    is    too    fine    for    that.” 1590 1589  Lord    Henry    looked    across    the    table.    “Dorian    is    never    annoyed    with    me,”    he    answered.    “I    asked    the    question 1591 1590  for    the    best    reason    possible,    for    the    only    reason,    indeed,    that    excuses    one    for    asking    any    question—simple 1592 1591  curiosity.    I    have    a    theory    that    it    is    always    the    women    who    propose    to    us,    and    not    we    who    propose    to    the    women. 1593 1592  Except,    of    course,    in    middle-class    life.    But    then    the    middle    classes    are    not    modern.” 1594 1593  Dorian    Gray    laughed,    and    tossed    his    head.    “You    are    quite    incorrigible,    Harry;    but    I    don’t    mind.    It    is    impossible 1595 1594  to    be    angry    with    you.    When    you    see    Sibyl    Vane,    you    will    feel    that    the    man    who    could    wrong    her    would    be    a 1596 1595  beast,    a    beast    without    a    heart.    I    cannot    understand    how    any    one    can    wish    to    shame    the    thing    he    loves.    I    love 1597 1596  Sibyl    Vane.    I    want    to    place    her    on    a    pedestal    of    gold    and    to    see    the    world    worship    the    woman    who    is    mine. 1598 1597  What    is    marriage?    An    irrevocable    vow.    You    mock    at    it    for    that.    Ah!    don’t    mock.    It    is    an    irrevocable    vow    that    I 1599 1598  want    to    take.    Her    trust    makes    me    faithful,    her    belief    makes    me    good.    When    I    am    with    her,    I    regret    all    that    you 1600 1599  have    taught    me.    I    become    diﬀerent    from    what    you    have    known    me    to    be.    I    am    changed,    and    the    mere    touch    of 1601 1600  Sibyl    Vane’s    hand    makes    me    forget    you    and    all    your    wrong,    fascinating,    poisonous,    delightful    theories.” 1602 1601  “And    those    are    ...?”    asked    Lord    Henry,    helping    himself    to    some    salad. 1603 1602  “Oh,    your    theories    about    life,    your    theories    about    love,    your    theories    about    pleasure.    All    your    theories,    in    fact, 1604 1603  Harry.” 1605 1604  “Pleasure    is    the    only    thing    worth    having    a    theory    about,”    he    answered    in    his    slow    melodious    voice.    “But    I    am 1606 1605  afraid    I    cannot    claim    my    theory    as    my    own.    It    belongs    to    Nature,    not    to    me.    Pleasure    is    Nature’s    test,    her    sign    of 1607 1606  approval.    When    we    are    happy,    we    are    always    good,    but    when    we    are    good,    we    are    not    always    happy.” 1608 1607  “Ah!    but    what    do    you    mean    by    good?”    cried    Basil    Hallward. 1609 1608  “Yes,”    echoed    Dorian,    leaning    back    in    his    chair    and    looking    at    Lord    Henry    over    the    heavy    clusters    of    purple- 1610 1609  lipped    irises    that    stood    in    the    centre    of    the    table,    “what    do    you    mean    by    good,    Harry?” 1611 1610  “To    be    good    is    to    be    in    harmony    with    one’s    self,”    he    replied,    touching    the    thin    stem    of    his    glass    with    his    pale, 1612 1611  ﬁne-pointed    ﬁngers.    “Discord    is    to    be    forced    to    be    in    harmony    with    others.    One’s    own    life—that    is    the    important 1613 1612  thing.    As    for    the    lives    of    one’s    neighbours,    if    one    wishes    to    be    a    prig    or    a    Puritan,    one    can    ﬂaunt    one’s    moral 1614 1613  views    about    them,    but    they    are    not    one’s    concern.    Besides,    individualism    has    really    the    higher    aim.    Modern 1615 1614  morality    consists    in    accepting    the    standard    of    one’s    age.    I    consider    that    for    any    man    of    culture    to    accept    the 1616 1615  standard    of    his    age    is    a    form    of    the    grossest    immorality.” 1617 1616  “But,    surely,    if    one    lives    merely    for    one’s    self,    Harry,    one    pays    a    terrible    price    for    doing    so?”    suggested    the 1618 1617  painter. 1619 1618  “Yes,    we    are    overcharged    for    everything    nowadays.    I    should    fancy    that    the    real    tragedy    of    the    poor    is    that 1620 1619  they    can    afford    nothing    but    self-denial.    Beautiful    sins,    like    beautiful    things,    are    the    privilege    of    the    rich.” 1621 1620  “One    has    to    pay    in    other    ways    but    money.” 1622 1621  “What    sort    of    ways,    Basil?” 1623 1622  “Oh!    I    should    fancy    in    remorse,    in    suffering,    in    ...    well,    in    the    consciousness    of    degradation.” 1624 1623  Lord    Henry    shrugged    his    shoulders.    “My    dear    fellow,    mediæval    art    is    charming,    but    mediæval    emotions    are 1625 1624  out    of    date.    One    can    use    them    in    ﬁction,    of    course.    But    then    the    only    things    that    one    can    use    in    ﬁction    are    the 1626 1625  things    that    one    has    ceased    to    use    in    fact.    Believe    me,    no    civilized    man    ever    regrets    a    pleasure,    and    no 1627 1626  uncivilized    man    ever    knows    what    a    pleasure    is.” 1628 1627  \\x0c            “I    know    what    pleasure    is,”    cried    Dorian    Gray.    “It    is    to    adore    some    one.” 1629 1628  “That    is    certainly    better    than    being    adored,”    he    answered,    toying    with    some    fruits.    “Being    adored    is    a 1630 1629  nuisance.    Women    treat    us    just    as    humanity    treats    its    gods.    They    worship    us,    and    are    always    bothering    us    to    do 1631 1630  something    for    them.” 1632 1631  “I    should    have    said    that    whatever    they    ask    for    they    had    ﬁrst    given    to    us,”    murmured    the    lad    gravely.    “They 1633 1632  create    love    in    our    natures.    They    have    a    right    to    demand    it    back.” 1634 1633  “That    is    quite    true,    Dorian,”    cried    Hallward. 1635 1634  “Nothing    is    ever    quite    true,”    said    Lord    Henry. 1636 1635  “This    is,”    interrupted    Dorian.    “You    must    admit,    Harry,    that    women    give    to    men    the    very    gold    of    their    lives.” 1637 1636  “Possibly,”    he    sighed,    “but    they    invariably    want    it    back    in    such    very    small    change.    That    is    the    worry.    Women, 1638 1637  as    some    witty    Frenchman    once    put    it,    inspire    us    with    the    desire    to    do    masterpieces    and    always    prevent    us    from 1639 1638  carrying    them    out.” 1640 1639  “Harry,    you    are    dreadful!    I    don’t    know    why    I    like    you    so    much.” 1641 1640  “You    will    always    like    me,    Dorian,”    he    replied.    “Will    you    have    some    coﬀee,    you    fellows?    Waiter,    bring    coﬀee, 1642 1641  and    fine-champagne,    and    some    cigarettes.    No,    don’t    mind    the    cigarettes—I    have    some.    Basil,    I    can’t    allow    you 1643 1642  to    smoke    cigars.    You    must    have    a    cigarette.    A    cigarette    is    the    perfect    type    of    a    perfect    pleasure.    It    is    exquisite, 1644 1643  and    it    leaves    one    unsatisﬁed.    What    more    can    one    want?    Yes,    Dorian,    you    will    always    be    fond    of    me.    I    represent 1645 1644  to    you    all    the    sins    you    have    never    had    the    courage    to    commit.” 1646 1645  “What    nonsense    you    talk,    Harry!”    cried    the    lad,    taking    a    light    from    a    ﬁre-breathing    silver    dragon    that    the    waiter 1647 1646  had    placed    on    the    table.    “Let    us    go    down    to    the    theatre.    When    Sibyl    comes    on    the    stage    you    will    have    a    new 1648 1647  ideal    of    life.    She    will    represent    something    to    you    that    you    have    never    known.” 1649 1648  “I    have    known    everything,”    said    Lord    Henry,    with    a    tired    look    in    his    eyes,    “but    I    am    always    ready    for    a    new 1650 1649  emotion.    I    am    afraid,    however,    that,    for    me    at    any    rate,    there    is    no    such    thing.    Still,    your    wonderful    girl    may    thrill 1651 1650  me.    I    love    acting.    It    is    so    much    more    real    than    life.    Let    us    go.    Dorian,    you    will    come    with    me.    I    am    so    sorry, 1652 1651  Basil,    but    there    is    only    room    for    two    in    the    brougham.    You    must    follow    us    in    a    hansom.” 1653 1652  They    got    up    and    put    on    their    coats,    sipping    their    coﬀee    standing.    The    painter    was    silent    and    preoccupied. 1654 1653  There    was    a    gloom    over    him.    He    could    not    bear    this    marriage,    and    yet    it    seemed    to    him    to    be    better    than    many 1655 1654  other    things    that    might    have    happened.    After    a    few    minutes,    they    all    passed    downstairs.    He    drove    oﬀ    by    himself, 1656 1655  as    had    been    arranged,    and    watched    the    ﬂashing    lights    of    the    little    brougham    in    front    of    him.    A    strange    sense    of 1657 1656  loss    came    over    him.    He    felt    that    Dorian    Gray    would    never    again    be    to    him    all    that    he    had    been    in    the    past.    Life 1658 1657  had    come    between    them....    His    eyes    darkened,    and    the    crowded    ﬂaring    streets    became    blurred    to    his    eyes. 1659 1658  When    the    cab    drew    up    at    the    theatre,    it    seemed    to    him    that    he    had    grown    years    older. 1660 1659  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                                                            CHAPTER    VII. 1661 1660  For    some    reason    or    other,    the    house    was    crowded    that    night,    and    the    fat    Jew    manager    who    met    them    at    the 1662 1661  door    was    beaming    from    ear    to    ear    with    an    oily    tremulous    smile.    He    escorted    them    to    their    box    with    a    sort    of 1663 1662  pompous    humility,    waving    his    fat    jewelled    hands    and    talking    at    the    top    of    his    voice.    Dorian    Gray    loathed    him 1664 1663  more    than    ever.    He    felt    as    if    he    had    come    to    look    for    Miranda    and    had    been    met    by    Caliban.    Lord    Henry,    upon 1665 1664  the    other    hand,    rather    liked    him.    At    least    he    declared    he    did,    and    insisted    on    shaking    him    by    the    hand    and 1666 1665  assuring    him    that    he    was    proud    to    meet    a    man    who    had    discovered    a    real    genius    and    gone    bankrupt    over    a 1667 1666  poet.    Hallward    amused    himself    with    watching    the    faces    in    the    pit.    The    heat    was    terribly    oppressive,    and    the 1668 1667  huge    sunlight    ﬂamed    like    a    monstrous    dahlia    with    petals    of    yellow    ﬁre.    The    youths    in    the    gallery    had    taken    oﬀ 1669 1668  their    coats    and    waistcoats    and    hung    them    over    the    side.    They    talked    to    each    other    across    the    theatre    and 1670 1669  shared    their    oranges    with    the    tawdry    girls    who    sat    beside    them.    Some    women    were    laughing    in    the    pit.    Their 1671 1670  voices    were    horribly    shrill    and    discordant.    The    sound    of    the    popping    of    corks    came    from    the    bar. 1672 1671  “What    a    place    to    find    one’s    divinity    in!”    said    Lord    Henry. 1673 1672  “Yes!”    answered    Dorian    Gray.    “It    was    here    I    found    her,    and    she    is    divine    beyond    all    living    things.    When    she 1674 1673  acts,    you    will    forget    everything.    These    common    rough    people,    with    their    coarse    faces    and    brutal    gestures, 1675 1674  become    quite    diﬀerent    when    she    is    on    the    stage.    They    sit    silently    and    watch    her.    They    weep    and    laugh    as    she 1676 1675  wills    them    to    do.    She    makes    them    as    responsive    as    a    violin.    She    spiritualizes    them,    and    one    feels    that    they    are 1677 1676  of    the    same    flesh    and    blood    as    one’s    self.” 1678 1677  “The    same    ﬂesh    and    blood    as    one’s    self!    Oh,    I    hope    not!”    exclaimed    Lord    Henry,    who    was    scanning    the 1679 1678  occupants    of    the    gallery    through    his    opera-glass. 1680 1679  “Don’t    pay    any    attention    to    him,    Dorian,”    said    the    painter.    “I    understand    what    you    mean,    and    I    believe    in    this 1681 1680  girl.    Any    one    you    love    must    be    marvellous,    and    any    girl    who    has    the    eﬀect    you    describe    must    be    ﬁne    and    noble. 1682 1681  To    spiritualize    one’s    age—that    is    something    worth    doing.    If    this    girl    can    give    a    soul    to    those    who    have    lived 1683 1682  without    one,    if    she    can    create    the    sense    of    beauty    in    people    whose    lives    have    been    sordid    and    ugly,    if    she    can 1684 1683  strip    them    of    their    selﬁshness    and    lend    them    tears    for    sorrows    that    are    not    their    own,    she    is    worthy    of    all    your 1685 1684  adoration,    worthy    of    the    adoration    of    the    world.    This    marriage    is    quite    right.    I    did    not    think    so    at    ﬁrst,    but    I    admit 1686 1685  it    now.    The    gods    made    Sibyl    Vane    for    you.    Without    her    you    would    have    been    incomplete.” 1687 1686  “Thanks,    Basil,”    answered    Dorian    Gray,    pressing    his    hand.    “I    knew    that    you    would    understand    me.    Harry    is    so 1688 1687  cynical,    he    terrifies    me.    But    here    is    the    orchestra.    It    is    quite    dreadful,    but    it    only    lasts    for    about    five    minutes.    The 1689 1688  the    curtain    rises,    and    you    will    see    the    girl    to    whom    I    am    going    to    give    all    my    life,    to    whom    I    have    given 1690 1689  everything    that    is    good    in    me.” 1691 1690  A    quarter    of    an    hour    afterwards,    amidst    an    extraordinary    turmoil    of    applause,    Sibyl    Vane    stepped    on    to    the 1692 1691  stage.    Yes,    she    was    certainly    lovely    to    look    at—one    of    the    loveliest    creatures,    Lord    Henry    thought,    that    he    had 1693 1692  ever    seen.    There    was    something    of    the    fawn    in    her    shy    grace    and    startled    eyes.    A    faint    blush,    like    the    shadow 1694 1693  of    a    rose    in    a    mirror    of    silver,    came    to    her    cheeks    as    she    glanced    at    the    crowded    enthusiastic    house.    She 1695 1694  stepped    back    a    few    paces    and    her    lips    seemed    to    tremble.    Basil    Hallward    leaped    to    his    feet    and    began    to 1696 1695  applaud.    Motionless,    and    as    one    in    a    dream,    sat    Dorian    Gray,    gazing    at    her.    Lord    Henry    peered    through    his 1697 1696  glasses,    murmuring,    “Charming!    charming!” 1698 1697  The    scene    was    the    hall    of    Capulet’s    house,    and    Romeo    in    his    pilgrim’s    dress    had    entered    with    Mercutio    and 1699 1698  his    other    friends.    The    band,    such    as    it    was,    struck    up    a    few    bars    of    music,    and    the    dance    began.    Through    the 1700 1699  crowd    of    ungainly,    shabbily    dressed    actors,    Sibyl    Vane    moved    like    a    creature    from    a    ﬁner    world.    Her    body 1701 1700  swayed,    while    she    danced,    as    a    plant    sways    in    the    water.    The    curves    of    her    throat    were    the    curves    of    a    white 1702 1701  lily.    Her    hands    seemed    to    be    made    of    cool    ivory. 1703 1702  Yet    she    was    curiously    listless.    She    showed    no    sign    of    joy    when    her    eyes    rested    on    Romeo.    The    few    words 1704 1703  she    had    to    speak— 1705 1704  Good    pilgrim,    you    do    wrong    your    hand    too    much, 1706 1705  Which    mannerly    devotion    shows    in    this; 1707 1706  For    saints    have    hands    that    pilgrims’    hands    do    touch, 1708 1707  And    palm    to    palm    is    holy    palmers’    kiss— 1709 1708  with    the    brief    dialogue    that    follows,    were    spoken    in    a    thoroughly    artiﬁcial    manner.    The    voice    was    exquisite,    but 1710 1709  from    the    point    of    view    of    tone    it    was    absolutely    false.    It    was    wrong    in    colour.    It    took    away    all    the    life    from    the 1711 1710  verse.    It    made    the    passion    unreal. 1712 1711  Dorian    Gray    grew    pale    as    he    watched    her.    He    was    puzzled    and    anxious.    Neither    of    his    friends    dared    to    say 1713 1712  anything    to    him.    She    seemed    to    them    to    be    absolutely    incompetent.    They    were    horribly    disappointed. 1714 1713  Yet    they    felt    that    the    true    test    of    any    Juliet    is    the    balcony    scene    of    the    second    act.    They    waited    for    that.    If    she 1715 1714  failed    there,    there    was    nothing    in    her. 1716 1715  She    looked    charming    as    she    came    out    in    the    moonlight.    That    could    not    be    denied.    But    the    staginess    of    her 1717 1716  acting    was    unbearable,    and    grew    worse    as    she    went    on.    Her    gestures    became    absurdly    artiﬁcial.    She 1718 1717  overemphasized    everything    that    she    had    to    say.    The    beautiful    passage— 1719 1718  Thou    knowest    the    mask    of    night    is    on    my    face, 1720 1719  Else    would    a    maiden    blush    bepaint    my    cheek 1721 1720  For    that    which    thou    hast    heard    me    speak    to-night— 1722 1721  was    declaimed    with    the    painful    precision    of    a    schoolgirl    who    has    been    taught    to    recite    by    some    second-rate 1723 1722  professor    of    elocution.    When    she    leaned    over    the    balcony    and    came    to    those    wonderful    lines— 1724 1723  Although    I    joy    in    thee, 1725 1724  I    have    no    joy    of    this    contract    to-night: 1726 1725  \\x0c                                            It    is    too    rash,    too    unadvised,    too    sudden; 1727 1726  Too    like    the    lightning,    which    doth    cease    to    be 1728 1727  Ere    one    can    say,    “It    lightens.”    Sweet,    good-night! 1729 1728  This    bud    of    love    by    summer’s    ripening    breath 1730 1729  May    prove    a    beauteous    flower    when    next    we    meet— 1731 1730  she    spoke    the    words    as    though    they    conveyed    no    meaning    to    her.    It    was    not    nervousness.    Indeed,    so    far    from 1732 1731  being    nervous,    she    was    absolutely    self-contained.    It    was    simply    bad    art.    She    was    a    complete    failure. 1733 1732  Even    the    common    uneducated    audience    of    the    pit    and    gallery    lost    their    interest    in    the    play.    They    got    restless, 1734 1733  and    began    to    talk    loudly    and    to    whistle.    The    Jew    manager,    who    was    standing    at    the    back    of    the    dress-circle, 1735 1734  stamped    and    swore    with    rage.    The    only    person    unmoved    was    the    girl    herself. 1736 1735  When    the    second    act    was    over,    there    came    a    storm    of    hisses,    and    Lord    Henry    got    up    from    his    chair    and    put 1737 1736  on    his    coat.    “She    is    quite    beautiful,    Dorian,”    he    said,    “but    she    can’t    act.    Let    us    go.” 1738 1737  “I    am    going    to    see    the    play    through,”    answered    the    lad,    in    a    hard    bitter    voice.    “I    am    awfully    sorry    that    I    have 1739 1738  made    you    waste    an    evening,    Harry.    I    apologize    to    you    both.” 1740 1739  “My    dear    Dorian,    I    should    think    Miss    Vane    was    ill,”    interrupted    Hallward.    “We    will    come    some    other    night.” 1741 1740  “I    wish    she    were    ill,”    he    rejoined.    “But    she    seems    to    me    to    be    simply    callous    and    cold.    She    has    entirely 1742 1741  altered.    Last    night    she    was    a    great    artist.    This    evening    she    is    merely    a    commonplace    mediocre    actress.” 1743 1742  “Don’t    talk    like    that    about    any    one    you    love,    Dorian.    Love    is    a    more    wonderful    thing    than    art.” 1744 1743  “They    are    both    simply    forms    of    imitation,”    remarked    Lord    Henry.    “But    do    let    us    go.    Dorian,    you    must    not    stay 1745 1744  here    any    longer.    It    is    not    good    for    one’s    morals    to    see    bad    acting.    Besides,    I    don’t    suppose    you    will    want    your 1746 1745  wife    to    act,    so    what    does    it    matter    if    she    plays    Juliet    like    a    wooden    doll?    She    is    very    lovely,    and    if    she    knows    as 1747 1746  little    about    life    as    she    does    about    acting,    she    will    be    a    delightful    experience.    There    are    only    two    kinds    of    people 1748 1747  who    are    really    fascinating—people    who    know    absolutely    everything,    and    people    who    know    absolutely    nothing. 1749 1748  Good    heavens,    my    dear    boy,    don’t    look    so    tragic!    The    secret    of    remaining    young    is    never    to    have    an    emotion 1750 1749  that    is    unbecoming.    Come    to    the    club    with    Basil    and    myself.    We    will    smoke    cigarettes    and    drink    to    the    beauty    of 1751 1750  Sibyl    Vane.    She    is    beautiful.    What    more    can    you    want?” 1752 1751  “Go    away,    Harry,”    cried    the    lad.    “I    want    to    be    alone.    Basil,    you    must    go.    Ah!    can’t    you    see    that    my    heart    is 1753 1752  breaking?”    The    hot    tears    came    to    his    eyes.    His    lips    trembled,    and    rushing    to    the    back    of    the    box,    he    leaned    up 1754 1753  against    the    wall,    hiding    his    face    in    his    hands. 1755 1754  “Let    us    go,    Basil,”    said    Lord    Henry    with    a    strange    tenderness    in    his    voice,    and    the    two    young    men    passed    out 1756 1755  together. 1757 1756  A    few    moments    afterwards    the    footlights    ﬂared    up    and    the    curtain    rose    on    the    third    act.    Dorian    Gray    went 1758 1757  back    to    his    seat.    He    looked    pale,    and    proud,    and    indiﬀerent.    The    play    dragged    on,    and    seemed    interminable. 1759 1758  Half    of    the    audience    went    out,    tramping    in    heavy    boots    and    laughing.    The    whole    thing    was    a    fiasco.    The    last    act 1760 1759  was    played    to    almost    empty    benches.    The    curtain    went    down    on    a    titter    and    some    groans. 1761 1760  As    soon    as    it    was    over,    Dorian    Gray    rushed    behind    the    scenes    into    the    greenroom.    The    girl    was    standing 1762 1761  there    alone,    with    a    look    of    triumph    on    her    face.    Her    eyes    were    lit    with    an    exquisite    ﬁre.    There    was    a    radiance 1763 1762  about    her.    Her    parted    lips    were    smiling    over    some    secret    of    their    own. 1764 1763  When    he    entered,    she    looked    at    him,    and    an    expression    of    inﬁnite    joy    came    over    her.    “How    badly    I    acted    to- 1765 1764  night,    Dorian!”    she    cried. 1766 1765  “Horribly!”    he    answered,    gazing    at    her    in    amazement.    “Horribly!    It    was    dreadful.    Are    you    ill?    You    have    no    idea 1767 1766  what    it    was.    You    have    no    idea    what    I    suffered.” 1768 1767  The    girl    smiled.    “Dorian,”    she    answered,    lingering    over    his    name    with    long-drawn    music    in    her    voice,    as 1769 1768  though    it    were    sweeter    than    honey    to    the    red    petals    of    her    mouth.    “Dorian,    you    should    have    understood.    But    you 1770 1769  understand    now,    don’t    you?” 1771 1770  “Understand    what?”    he    asked,    angrily. 1772 1771  “Why    I    was    so    bad    to-night.    Why    I    shall    always    be    bad.    Why    I    shall    never    act    well    again.” 1773 1772  He    shrugged    his    shoulders.    “You    are    ill,    I    suppose.    When    you    are    ill    you    shouldn’t    act.    You    make    yourself 1774 1773  ridiculous.    My    friends    were    bored.    I    was    bored.” 1775 1774  She    seemed    not    to    listen    to    him.    She    was    transfigured    with    joy.    An    ecstasy    of    happiness    dominated    her. 1776 1775  “Dorian,    Dorian,”    she    cried,    “before    I    knew    you,    acting    was    the    one    reality    of    my    life.    It    was    only    in    the    theatre 1777 1776  that    I    lived.    I    thought    that    it    was    all    true.    I    was    Rosalind    one    night    and    Portia    the    other.    The    joy    of    Beatrice    was 1778 1777  my    joy,    and    the    sorrows    of    Cordelia    were    mine    also.    I    believed    in    everything.    The    common    people    who    acted 1779 1778  with    me    seemed    to    me    to    be    godlike.    The    painted    scenes    were    my    world.    I    knew    nothing    but    shadows,    and    I 1780 1779  thought    them    real.    You    came—oh,    my    beautiful    love!—and    you    freed    my    soul    from    prison.    You    taught    me    what 1781 1780  reality    really    is.    To-night,    for    the    ﬁrst    time    in    my    life,    I    saw    through    the    hollowness,    the    sham,    the    silliness    of    the 1782 1781  empty    pageant    in    which    I    had    always    played.    To-night,    for    the    ﬁrst    time,    I    became    conscious    that    the    Romeo 1783 1782  was    hideous,    and    old,    and    painted,    that    the    moonlight    in    the    orchard    was    false,    that    the    scenery    was    vulgar,    and 1784 1783  that    the    words    I    had    to    speak    were    unreal,    were    not    my    words,    were    not    what    I    wanted    to    say.    You    had    brought 1785 1784  me    something    higher,    something    of    which    all    art    is    but    a    reﬂection.    You    had    made    me    understand    what    love 1786 1785  really    is.    My    love!    My    love!    Prince    Charming!    Prince    of    life!    I    have    grown    sick    of    shadows.    You    are    more    to    me 1787 1786  than    all    art    can    ever    be.    What    have    I    to    do    with    the    puppets    of    a    play?    When    I    came    on    to-night,    I    could    not 1788 1787  understand    how    it    was    that    everything    had    gone    from    me.    I    thought    that    I    was    going    to    be    wonderful.    I    found    that 1789 1788  I    could    do    nothing.    Suddenly    it    dawned    on    my    soul    what    it    all    meant.    The    knowledge    was    exquisite    to    me.    I 1790 1789  heard    them    hissing,    and    I    smiled.    What    could    they    know    of    love    such    as    ours?    Take    me    away,    Dorian—take    me 1791 1790  away    with    you,    where    we    can    be    quite    alone.    I    hate    the    stage.    I    might    mimic    a    passion    that    I    do    not    feel,    but    I 1792 1791  cannot    mimic    one    that    burns    me    like    ﬁre.    Oh,    Dorian,    Dorian,    you    understand    now    what    it    signiﬁes?    Even    if    I 1793 1792  could    do    it,    it    would    be    profanation    for    me    to    play    at    being    in    love.    You    have    made    me    see    that.” 1794 1793  He    flung    himself    down    on    the    sofa    and    turned    away    his    face.    “You    have    killed    my    love,”    he    muttered. 1795 1794  \\x0c                She    looked    at    him    in    wonder    and    laughed.    He    made    no    answer.    She    came    across    to    him,    and    with    her    little 1796 1795  ﬁngers    stroked    his    hair.    She    knelt    down    and    pressed    his    hands    to    her    lips.    He    drew    them    away,    and    a    shudder 1797 1796  ran    through    him. 1798 1797  Then    he    leaped    up    and    went    to    the    door.    “Yes,”    he    cried,    “you    have    killed    my    love.    You    used    to    stir    my 1799 1798  imagination.    Now    you    don’t    even    stir    my    curiosity.    You    simply    produce    no    eﬀect.    I    loved    you    because    you    were 1800 1799  marvellous,    because    you    had    genius    and    intellect,    because    you    realized    the    dreams    of    great    poets    and    gave 1801 1800  shape    and    substance    to    the    shadows    of    art.    You    have    thrown    it    all    away.    You    are    shallow    and    stupid.    My    God! 1802 1801  how    mad    I    was    to    love    you!    What    a    fool    I    have    been!    You    are    nothing    to    me    now.    I    will    never    see    you    again.    I 1803 1802  will    never    think    of    you.    I    will    never    mention    your    name.    You    don’t    know    what    you    were    to    me,    once.    Why,    once 1804 1803  ...    Oh,    I    can’t    bear    to    think    of    it!    I    wish    I    had    never    laid    eyes    upon    you!    You    have    spoiled    the    romance    of    my    life. 1805 1804  How    little    you    can    know    of    love,    if    you    say    it    mars    your    art!    Without    your    art,    you    are    nothing.    I    would    have    made 1806 1805  you    famous,    splendid,    magnificent.    The    world    would    have    worshipped    you,    and    you    would    have    borne    my    name. 1807 1806  What    are    you    now?    A    third-rate    actress    with    a    pretty    face.” 1808 1807  The    girl    grew    white,    and    trembled.    She    clenched    her    hands    together,    and    her    voice    seemed    to    catch    in    her 1809 1808  throat.    “You    are    not    serious,    Dorian?”    she    murmured.    “You    are    acting.” 1810 1809  “Acting!    I    leave    that    to    you.    You    do    it    so    well,”    he    answered    bitterly. 1811 1810  She    rose    from    her    knees    and,    with    a    piteous    expression    of    pain    in    her    face,    came    across    the    room    to    him. 1812 1811  She    put    her    hand    upon    his    arm    and    looked    into    his    eyes.    He    thrust    her    back.    “Don’t    touch    me!”    he    cried. 1813 1812  A    low    moan    broke    from    her,    and    she    ﬂung    herself    at    his    feet    and    lay    there    like    a    trampled    ﬂower.    “Dorian, 1814 1813  Dorian,    don’t    leave    me!”    she    whispered.    “I    am    so    sorry    I    didn’t    act    well.    I    was    thinking    of    you    all    the    time.    But    I 1815 1814  will    try—indeed,    I    will    try.    It    came    so    suddenly    across    me,    my    love    for    you.    I    think    I    should    never    have    known    it    if 1816 1815  you    had    not    kissed    me—if    we    had    not    kissed    each    other.    Kiss    me    again,    my    love.    Don’t    go    away    from    me.    I 1817 1816  couldn’t    bear    it.    Oh!    don’t    go    away    from    me.    My    brother    ...    No;    never    mind.    He    didn’t    mean    it.    He    was    in    jest.... 1818 1817  But    you,    oh!    can’t    you    forgive    me    for    to-night?    I    will    work    so    hard    and    try    to    improve.    Don’t    be    cruel    to    me, 1819 1818  because    I    love    you    better    than    anything    in    the    world.    After    all,    it    is    only    once    that    I    have    not    pleased    you.    But    you 1820 1819  are    quite    right,    Dorian.    I    should    have    shown    myself    more    of    an    artist.    It    was    foolish    of    me,    and    yet    I    couldn’t    help 1821 1820  it.    Oh,    don’t    leave    me,    don’t    leave    me.”    A    ﬁt    of    passionate    sobbing    choked    her.    She    crouched    on    the    ﬂoor    like    a 1822 1821  wounded    thing,    and    Dorian    Gray,    with    his    beautiful    eyes,    looked    down    at    her,    and    his    chiselled    lips    curled    in 1823 1822  exquisite    disdain.    There    is    always    something    ridiculous    about    the    emotions    of    people    whom    one    has    ceased    to 1824 1823  love.    Sibyl    Vane    seemed    to    him    to    be    absurdly    melodramatic.    Her    tears    and    sobs    annoyed    him. 1825 1824  “I    am    going,”    he    said    at    last    in    his    calm    clear    voice.    “I    don’t    wish    to    be    unkind,    but    I    can’t    see    you    again.    You 1826 1825  have    disappointed    me.” 1827 1826  She    wept    silently,    and    made    no    answer,    but    crept    nearer.    Her    little    hands    stretched    blindly    out,    and    appeared 1828 1827  to    be    seeking    for    him.    He    turned    on    his    heel    and    left    the    room.    In    a    few    moments    he    was    out    of    the    theatre. 1829 1828  Where    he    went    to    he    hardly    knew.    He    remembered    wandering    through    dimly    lit    streets,    past    gaunt,    black- 1830 1829  shadowed    archways    and    evil-looking    houses.    Women    with    hoarse    voices    and    harsh    laughter    had    called    after 1831 1830  him.    Drunkards    had    reeled    by,    cursing    and    chattering    to    themselves    like    monstrous    apes.    He    had    seen 1832 1831  grotesque    children    huddled    upon    door-steps,    and    heard    shrieks    and    oaths    from    gloomy    courts. 1833 1832  As    the    dawn    was    just    breaking,    he    found    himself    close    to    Covent    Garden.    The    darkness    lifted,    and,    ﬂushed 1834 1833  with    faint    ﬁres,    the    sky    hollowed    itself    into    a    perfect    pearl.    Huge    carts    ﬁlled    with    nodding    lilies    rumbled    slowly 1835 1834  down    the    polished    empty    street.    The    air    was    heavy    with    the    perfume    of    the    ﬂowers,    and    their    beauty    seemed    to 1836 1835  bring    him    an    anodyne    for    his    pain.    He    followed    into    the    market    and    watched    the    men    unloading    their    waggons. 1837 1836  A    white-smocked    carter    oﬀered    him    some    cherries.    He    thanked    him,    wondered    why    he    refused    to    accept    any 1838 1837  money    for    them,    and    began    to    eat    them    listlessly.    They    had    been    plucked    at    midnight,    and    the    coldness    of    the 1839 1838  moon    had    entered    into    them.    A    long    line    of    boys    carrying    crates    of    striped    tulips,    and    of    yellow    and    red    roses, 1840 1839  deﬁled    in    front    of    him,    threading    their    way    through    the    huge,    jade-green    piles    of    vegetables.    Under    the    portico, 1841 1840  with    its    grey,    sun-bleached    pillars,    loitered    a    troop    of    draggled    bareheaded    girls,    waiting    for    the    auction    to    be 1842 1841  over.    Others    crowded    round    the    swinging    doors    of    the    coﬀee-house    in    the    piazza.    The    heavy    cart-horses 1843 1842  slipped    and    stamped    upon    the    rough    stones,    shaking    their    bells    and    trappings.    Some    of    the    drivers    were    lying 1844 1843  asleep    on    a    pile    of    sacks.    Iris-necked    and    pink-footed,    the    pigeons    ran    about    picking    up    seeds. 1845 1844  After    a    little    while,    he    hailed    a    hansom    and    drove    home.    For    a    few    moments    he    loitered    upon    the    doorstep, 1846 1845  looking    round    at    the    silent    square,    with    its    blank,    close-shuttered    windows    and    its    staring    blinds.    The    sky    was 1847 1846  pure    opal    now,    and    the    roofs    of    the    houses    glistened    like    silver    against    it.    From    some    chimney    opposite    a    thin 1848 1847  wreath    of    smoke    was    rising.    It    curled,    a    violet    riband,    through    the    nacre-coloured    air. 1849 1848  In    the    huge    gilt    Venetian    lantern,    spoil    of    some    Doge’s    barge,    that    hung    from    the    ceiling    of    the    great,    oak- 1850 1849  panelled    hall    of    entrance,    lights    were    still    burning    from    three    ﬂickering    jets:    thin    blue    petals    of    ﬂame    they 1851 1850  seemed,    rimmed    with    white    ﬁre.    He    turned    them    out    and,    having    thrown    his    hat    and    cape    on    the    table,    passed 1852 1851  through    the    library    towards    the    door    of    his    bedroom,    a    large    octagonal    chamber    on    the    ground    ﬂoor    that,    in    his 1853 1852  new-born    feeling    for    luxury,    he    had    just    had    decorated    for    himself    and    hung    with    some    curious    Renaissance 1854 1853  tapestries    that    had    been    discovered    stored    in    a    disused    attic    at    Selby    Royal.    As    he    was    turning    the    handle    of    the 1855 1854  door,    his    eye    fell    upon    the    portrait    Basil    Hallward    had    painted    of    him.    He    started    back    as    if    in    surprise.    Then    he 1856 1855  went    on    into    his    own    room,    looking    somewhat    puzzled.    After    he    had    taken    the    button-hole    out    of    his    coat,    he 1857 1856  seemed    to    hesitate.    Finally,    he    came    back,    went    over    to    the    picture,    and    examined    it.    In    the    dim    arrested    light 1858 1857  that    struggled    through    the    cream-coloured    silk    blinds,    the    face    appeared    to    him    to    be    a    little    changed.    The 1859 1858  expression    looked    diﬀerent.    One    would    have    said    that    there    was    a    touch    of    cruelty    in    the    mouth.    It    was    certainly 1860 1859  strange. 1861 1860  He    turned    round    and,    walking    to    the    window,    drew    up    the    blind.    The    bright    dawn    ﬂooded    the    room    and    swept 1862 1861  the    fantastic    shadows    into    dusky    corners,    where    they    lay    shuddering.    But    the    strange    expression    that    he    had 1863 1862  noticed    in    the    face    of    the    portrait    seemed    to    linger    there,    to    be    more    intensiﬁed    even.    The    quivering    ardent 1864 1863  sunlight    showed    him    the    lines    of    cruelty    round    the    mouth    as    clearly    as    if    he    had    been    looking    into    a    mirror    after 1865 1864  he    had    done    some    dreadful    thing. 1866 1865  \\x0c                He    winced    and,    taking    up    from    the    table    an    oval    glass    framed    in    ivory    Cupids,    one    of    Lord    Henry’s    many 1867 1866  presents    to    him,    glanced    hurriedly    into    its    polished    depths.    No    line    like    that    warped    his    red    lips.    What    did    it 1868 1867  mean? 1869 1868  He    rubbed    his    eyes,    and    came    close    to    the    picture,    and    examined    it    again.    There    were    no    signs    of    any 1870 1869  change    when    he    looked    into    the    actual    painting,    and    yet    there    was    no    doubt    that    the    whole    expression    had 1871 1870  altered.    It    was    not    a    mere    fancy    of    his    own.    The    thing    was    horribly    apparent. 1872 1871  He    threw    himself    into    a    chair    and    began    to    think.    Suddenly    there    ﬂashed    across    his    mind    what    he    had    said    in 1873 1872  Basil    Hallward’s    studio    the    day    the    picture    had    been    ﬁnished.    Yes,    he    remembered    it    perfectly.    He    had    uttered    a 1874 1873  mad    wish    that    he    himself    might    remain    young,    and    the    portrait    grow    old;    that    his    own    beauty    might    be 1875 1874  untarnished,    and    the    face    on    the    canvas    bear    the    burden    of    his    passions    and    his    sins;    that    the    painted    image 1876 1875  might    be    seared    with    the    lines    of    suﬀering    and    thought,    and    that    he    might    keep    all    the    delicate    bloom    and 1877 1876  loveliness    of    his    then    just    conscious    boyhood.    Surely    his    wish    had    not    been    fulﬁlled?    Such    things    were 1878 1877  impossible.    It    seemed    monstrous    even    to    think    of    them.    And,    yet,    there    was    the    picture    before    him,    with    the 1879 1878  touch    of    cruelty    in    the    mouth. 1880 1879  Cruelty!    Had    he    been    cruel?    It    was    the    girl’s    fault,    not    his.    He    had    dreamed    of    her    as    a    great    artist,    had    given 1881 1880  his    love    to    her    because    he    had    thought    her    great.    Then    she    had    disappointed    him.    She    had    been    shallow    and 1882 1881  unworthy.    And,    yet,    a    feeling    of    inﬁnite    regret    came    over    him,    as    he    thought    of    her    lying    at    his    feet    sobbing    like    a 1883 1882  little    child.    He    remembered    with    what    callousness    he    had    watched    her.    Why    had    he    been    made    like    that?    Why 1884 1883  had    such    a    soul    been    given    to    him?    But    he    had    suﬀered    also.    During    the    three    terrible    hours    that    the    play    had 1885 1884  lasted,    he    had    lived    centuries    of    pain,    aeon    upon    aeon    of    torture.    His    life    was    well    worth    hers.    She    had    marred 1886 1885  him    for    a    moment,    if    he    had    wounded    her    for    an    age.    Besides,    women    were    better    suited    to    bear    sorrow    than 1887 1886  men.    They    lived    on    their    emotions.    They    only    thought    of    their    emotions.    When    they    took    lovers,    it    was    merely    to 1888 1887  have    some    one    with    whom    they    could    have    scenes.    Lord    Henry    had    told    him    that,    and    Lord    Henry    knew    what 1889 1888  women    were.    Why    should    he    trouble    about    Sibyl    Vane?    She    was    nothing    to    him    now. 1890 1889  But    the    picture?    What    was    he    to    say    of    that?    It    held    the    secret    of    his    life,    and    told    his    story.    It    had    taught    him 1891 1890  to    love    his    own    beauty.    Would    it    teach    him    to    loathe    his    own    soul?    Would    he    ever    look    at    it    again? 1892 1891  No;    it    was    merely    an    illusion    wrought    on    the    troubled    senses.    The    horrible    night    that    he    had    passed    had    left 1893 1892  phantoms    behind    it.    Suddenly    there    had    fallen    upon    his    brain    that    tiny    scarlet    speck    that    makes    men    mad.    The 1894 1893  picture    had    not    changed.    It    was    folly    to    think    so. 1895 1894  Yet    it    was    watching    him,    with    its    beautiful    marred    face    and    its    cruel    smile.    Its    bright    hair    gleamed    in    the    early 1896 1895  sunlight.    Its    blue    eyes    met    his    own.    A    sense    of    inﬁnite    pity,    not    for    himself,    but    for    the    painted    image    of    himself, 1897 1896  came    over    him.    It    had    altered    already,    and    would    alter    more.    Its    gold    would    wither    into    grey.    Its    red    and    white 1898 1897  roses    would    die.    For    every    sin    that    he    committed,    a    stain    would    ﬂeck    and    wreck    its    fairness.    But    he    would    not 1899 1898  sin.    The    picture,    changed    or    unchanged,    would    be    to    him    the    visible    emblem    of    conscience.    He    would    resist 1900 1899  temptation.    He    would    not    see    Lord    Henry    any    more—would    not,    at    any    rate,    listen    to    those    subtle    poisonous 1901 1900  theories    that    in    Basil    Hallward’s    garden    had    ﬁrst    stirred    within    him    the    passion    for    impossible    things.    He    would 1902 1901  go    back    to    Sibyl    Vane,    make    her    amends,    marry    her,    try    to    love    her    again.    Yes,    it    was    his    duty    to    do    so.    She 1903 1902  must    have    suﬀered    more    than    he    had.    Poor    child!    He    had    been    selﬁsh    and    cruel    to    her.    The    fascination    that    she 1904 1903  had    exercised    over    him    would    return.    They    would    be    happy    together.    His    life    with    her    would    be    beautiful    and 1905 1904  pure. 1906 1905  He    got    up    from    his    chair    and    drew    a    large    screen    right    in    front    of    the    portrait,    shuddering    as    he    glanced    at    it. 1907 1906  “How    horrible!”    he    murmured    to    himself,    and    he    walked    across    to    the    window    and    opened    it.    When    he    stepped 1908 1907  out    on    to    the    grass,    he    drew    a    deep    breath.    The    fresh    morning    air    seemed    to    drive    away    all    his    sombre 1909 1908  passions.    He    thought    only    of    Sibyl.    A    faint    echo    of    his    love    came    back    to    him.    He    repeated    her    name    over    and 1910 1909  over    again.    The    birds    that    were    singing    in    the    dew-drenched    garden    seemed    to    be    telling    the    flowers    about    her. 1911 1910  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                        CHAPTER    VIII. 1912 1911  It    was    long    past    noon    when    he    awoke.    His    valet    had    crept    several    times    on    tiptoe    into    the    room    to    see    if    he 1913 1912  was    stirring,    and    had    wondered    what    made    his    young    master    sleep    so    late.    Finally    his    bell    sounded,    and    Victor 1914 1913  came    in    softly    with    a    cup    of    tea,    and    a    pile    of    letters,    on    a    small    tray    of    old    Sevres    china,    and    drew    back    the 1915 1914  olive-satin    curtains,    with    their    shimmering    blue    lining,    that    hung    in    front    of    the    three    tall    windows. 1916 1915  “Monsieur    has    well    slept    this    morning,”    he    said,    smiling. 1917 1916  “What    o’clock    is    it,    Victor?”    asked    Dorian    Gray    drowsily. 1918 1917  “One    hour    and    a    quarter,    Monsieur.” 1919 1918  How    late    it    was!    He    sat    up,    and    having    sipped    some    tea,    turned    over    his    letters.    One    of    them    was    from    Lord 1920 1919  Henry,    and    had    been    brought    by    hand    that    morning.    He    hesitated    for    a    moment,    and    then    put    it    aside.    The 1921 1920  others    he    opened    listlessly.    They    contained    the    usual    collection    of    cards,    invitations    to    dinner,    tickets    for    private 1922 1921  views,    programmes    of    charity    concerts,    and    the    like    that    are    showered    on    fashionable    young    men    every 1923 1922  morning    during    the    season.    There    was    a    rather    heavy    bill    for    a    chased    silver    Louis-Quinze    toilet-set    that    he    had 1924 1923  not    yet    had    the    courage    to    send    on    to    his    guardians,    who    were    extremely    old-fashioned    people    and    did    not 1925 1924  realize    that    we    live    in    an    age    when    unnecessary    things    are    our    only    necessities;    and    there    were    several    very 1926 1925  courteously    worded    communications    from    Jermyn    Street    money-lenders    oﬀering    to    advance    any    sum    of    money 1927 1926  at    a    moment’s    notice    and    at    the    most    reasonable    rates    of    interest. 1928 1927  After    about    ten    minutes    he    got    up,    and    throwing    on    an    elaborate    dressing-gown    of    silk-embroidered    cashmere 1929 1928  wool,    passed    into    the    onyx-paved    bathroom.    The    cool    water    refreshed    him    after    his    long    sleep.    He    seemed    to 1930 1929  have    forgotten    all    that    he    had    gone    through.    A    dim    sense    of    having    taken    part    in    some    strange    tragedy    came    to 1931 1930  him    once    or    twice,    but    there    was    the    unreality    of    a    dream    about    it. 1932 1931  As    soon    as    he    was    dressed,    he    went    into    the    library    and    sat    down    to    a    light    French    breakfast    that    had    been 1933 1932  laid    out    for    him    on    a    small    round    table    close    to    the    open    window.    It    was    an    exquisite    day.    The    warm    air    seemed 1934 1933  laden    with    spices.    A    bee    ﬂew    in    and    buzzed    round    the    blue-dragon    bowl    that,    ﬁlled    with    sulphur-yellow    roses, 1935 1934  stood    before    him.    He    felt    perfectly    happy. 1936 1935  Suddenly    his    eye    fell    on    the    screen    that    he    had    placed    in    front    of    the    portrait,    and    he    started. 1937 1936  “Too    cold    for    Monsieur?”    asked    his    valet,    putting    an    omelette    on    the    table.    “I    shut    the    window?” 1938 1937  Dorian    shook    his    head.    “I    am    not    cold,”    he    murmured. 1939 1938  Was    it    all    true?    Had    the    portrait    really    changed?    Or    had    it    been    simply    his    own    imagination    that    had    made    him 1940 1939  see    a    look    of    evil    where    there    had    been    a    look    of    joy?    Surely    a    painted    canvas    could    not    alter?    The    thing    was 1941 1940  absurd.    It    would    serve    as    a    tale    to    tell    Basil    some    day.    It    would    make    him    smile. 1942 1941  And,    yet,    how    vivid    was    his    recollection    of    the    whole    thing!    First    in    the    dim    twilight,    and    then    in    the    bright 1943 1942  dawn,    he    had    seen    the    touch    of    cruelty    round    the    warped    lips.    He    almost    dreaded    his    valet    leaving    the    room.    He 1944 1943  knew    that    when    he    was    alone    he    would    have    to    examine    the    portrait.    He    was    afraid    of    certainty.    When    the 1945 1944  coﬀee    and    cigarettes    had    been    brought    and    the    man    turned    to    go,    he    felt    a    wild    desire    to    tell    him    to    remain.    As 1946 1945  the    door    was    closing    behind    him,    he    called    him    back.    The    man    stood    waiting    for    his    orders.    Dorian    looked    at    him 1947 1946  for    a    moment.    “I    am    not    at    home    to    any    one,    Victor,”    he    said    with    a    sigh.    The    man    bowed    and    retired. 1948 1947  Then    he    rose    from    the    table,    lit    a    cigarette,    and    ﬂung    himself    down    on    a    luxuriously    cushioned    couch    that 1949 1948  stood    facing    the    screen.    The    screen    was    an    old    one,    of    gilt    Spanish    leather,    stamped    and    wrought    with    a    rather 1950 1949  ﬂorid    Louis-Quatorze    pattern.    He    scanned    it    curiously,    wondering    if    ever    before    it    had    concealed    the    secret    of    a 1951 1950  man’s    life. 1952 1951  Should    he    move    it    aside,    after    all?    Why    not    let    it    stay    there?    What    was    the    use    of    knowing?    If    the    thing    was 1953 1952  true,    it    was    terrible.    If    it    was    not    true,    why    trouble    about    it?    But    what    if,    by    some    fate    or    deadlier    chance,    eyes 1954 1953  other    than    his    spied    behind    and    saw    the    horrible    change?    What    should    he    do    if    Basil    Hallward    came    and    asked 1955 1954  to    look    at    his    own    picture?    Basil    would    be    sure    to    do    that.    No;    the    thing    had    to    be    examined,    and    at    once. 1956 1955  Anything    would    be    better    than    this    dreadful    state    of    doubt. 1957 1956  He    got    up    and    locked    both    doors.    At    least    he    would    be    alone    when    he    looked    upon    the    mask    of    his    shame. 1958 1957  Then    he    drew    the    screen    aside    and    saw    himself    face    to    face.    It    was    perfectly    true.    The    portrait    had    altered. 1959 1958  As    he    often    remembered    afterwards,    and    always    with    no    small    wonder,    he    found    himself    at    ﬁrst    gazing    at    the 1960 1959  portrait    with    a    feeling    of    almost    scientiﬁc    interest.    That    such    a    change    should    have    taken    place    was    incredible    to 1961 1960  him.    And    yet    it    was    a    fact.    Was    there    some    subtle    aﬃnity    between    the    chemical    atoms    that    shaped    themselves 1962 1961  into    form    and    colour    on    the    canvas    and    the    soul    that    was    within    him?    Could    it    be    that    what    that    soul    thought, 1963 1962  they    realized?—that    what    it    dreamed,    they    made    true?    Or    was    there    some    other,    more    terrible    reason?    He 1964 1963  shuddered,    and    felt    afraid,    and,    going    back    to    the    couch,    lay    there,    gazing    at    the    picture    in    sickened    horror. 1965 1964  One    thing,    however,    he    felt    that    it    had    done    for    him.    It    had    made    him    conscious    how    unjust,    how    cruel,    he    had 1966 1965  been    to    Sibyl    Vane.    It    was    not    too    late    to    make    reparation    for    that.    She    could    still    be    his    wife.    His    unreal    and 1967 1966  selﬁsh    love    would    yield    to    some    higher    inﬂuence,    would    be    transformed    into    some    nobler    passion,    and    the 1968 1967  portrait    that    Basil    Hallward    had    painted    of    him    would    be    a    guide    to    him    through    life,    would    be    to    him    what 1969 1968  holiness    is    to    some,    and    conscience    to    others,    and    the    fear    of    God    to    us    all.    There    were    opiates    for    remorse, 1970 1969  drugs    that    could    lull    the    moral    sense    to    sleep.    But    here    was    a    visible    symbol    of    the    degradation    of    sin.    Here    was 1971 1970  an    ever-present    sign    of    the    ruin    men    brought    upon    their    souls. 1972 1971  Three    o’clock    struck,    and    four,    and    the    half-hour    rang    its    double    chime,    but    Dorian    Gray    did    not    stir.    He    was 1973 1972  trying    to    gather    up    the    scarlet    threads    of    life    and    to    weave    them    into    a    pattern;    to    ﬁnd    his    way    through    the 1974 1973  sanguine    labyrinth    of    passion    through    which    he    was    wandering.    He    did    not    know    what    to    do,    or    what    to    think. 1975 1974  Finally,    he    went    over    to    the    table    and    wrote    a    passionate    letter    to    the    girl    he    had    loved,    imploring    her 1976 1975  forgiveness    and    accusing    himself    of    madness.    He    covered    page    after    page    with    wild    words    of    sorrow    and    wilder 1977 1976  words    of    pain.    There    is    a    luxury    in    self-reproach.    When    we    blame    ourselves,    we    feel    that    no    one    else    has    a    right 1978 1977  to    blame    us.    It    is    the    confession,    not    the    priest,    that    gives    us    absolution.    When    Dorian    had    ﬁnished    the    letter,    he 1979 1978  \\x0cfelt    that    he    had    been    forgiven. 1980 1979  Suddenly    there    came    a    knock    to    the    door,    and    he    heard    Lord    Henry’s    voice    outside.    “My    dear    boy,    I    must    see 1981 1980  you.    Let    me    in    at    once.    I    can’t    bear    your    shutting    yourself    up    like    this.” 1982 1981  He    made    no    answer    at    ﬁrst,    but    remained    quite    still.    The    knocking    still    continued    and    grew    louder.    Yes,    it    was 1983 1982  better    to    let    Lord    Henry    in,    and    to    explain    to    him    the    new    life    he    was    going    to    lead,    to    quarrel    with    him    if    it 1984 1983  became    necessary    to    quarrel,    to    part    if    parting    was    inevitable.    He    jumped    up,    drew    the    screen    hastily    across    the 1985 1984  picture,    and    unlocked    the    door. 1986 1985  “I    am    so    sorry    for    it    all,    Dorian,”    said    Lord    Henry    as    he    entered.    “But    you    must    not    think    too    much    about    it.” 1987 1986  “Do    you    mean    about    Sibyl    Vane?”    asked    the    lad. 1988 1987  “Yes,    of    course,”    answered    Lord    Henry,    sinking    into    a    chair    and    slowly    pulling    oﬀ    his    yellow    gloves.    “It    is 1989 1988  dreadful,    from    one    point    of    view,    but    it    was    not    your    fault.    Tell    me,    did    you    go    behind    and    see    her,    after    the    play 1990 1989  was    over?” 1991 1990  “Yes.” 1992 1991  “I    felt    sure    you    had.    Did    you    make    a    scene    with    her?” 1993 1992  “I    was    brutal,    Harry—perfectly    brutal.    But    it    is    all    right    now.    I    am    not    sorry    for    anything    that    has    happened.    It 1994 1993  has    taught    me    to    know    myself    better.” 1995 1994  “Ah,    Dorian,    I    am    so    glad    you    take    it    in    that    way!    I    was    afraid    I    would    ﬁnd    you    plunged    in    remorse    and    tearing 1996 1995  that    nice    curly    hair    of    yours.” 1997 1996  “I    have    got    through    all    that,”    said    Dorian,    shaking    his    head    and    smiling.    “I    am    perfectly    happy    now.    I    know 1998 1997  what    conscience    is,    to    begin    with.    It    is    not    what    you    told    me    it    was.    It    is    the    divinest    thing    in    us.    Don’t    sneer    at 1999 1998  Harry,    any    more—at    least    not    before    me.    I    want    to    be    good.    I    can’t    bear    the    idea    of    my    soul    being    hideous.” 2000 1999  “A    very    charming    artistic    basis    for    ethics,    Dorian!    I    congratulate    you    on    it.    But    how    are    you    going    to    begin?” 2001 2000  “By    marrying    Sibyl    Vane.” 2002 2001  “Marrying    Sibyl    Vane!”    cried    Lord    Henry,    standing    up    and    looking    at    him    in    perplexed    amazement.    “But,    my 2003 2002  dear    Dorian—” 2004 2003  “Yes,    Harry,    I    know    what    you    are    going    to    say.    Something    dreadful    about    marriage.    Don’t    say    it.    Don’t    ever 2005 2004  say    things    of    that    kind    to    me    again.    Two    days    ago    I    asked    Sibyl    to    marry    me.    I    am    not    going    to    break    my    word    to 2006 2005  her.    She    is    to    be    my    wife.” 2007 2006  “Your    wife!    Dorian!    ...    Didn’t    you    get    my    letter?    I    wrote    to    you    this    morning,    and    sent    the    note    down    by    my    own 2008 2007  man.” 2009 2008  “Your    letter?    Oh,    yes,    I    remember.    I    have    not    read    it    yet,    Harry.    I    was    afraid    there    might    be    something    in    it    that 2010 2009  I    wouldn’t    like.    You    cut    life    to    pieces    with    your    epigrams.” 2011 2010  “You    know    nothing    then?” 2012 2011  “What    do    you    mean?” 2013 2012  Lord    Henry    walked    across    the    room,    and    sitting    down    by    Dorian    Gray,    took    both    his    hands    in    his    own    and 2014 2013  held    them    tightly.    “Dorian,”    he    said,    “my    letter—don’t    be    frightened—was    to    tell    you    that    Sibyl    Vane    is    dead.” 2015 2014  A    cry    of    pain    broke    from    the    lad’s    lips,    and    he    leaped    to    his    feet,    tearing    his    hands    away    from    Lord    Henry’s 2016 2015  grasp.    “Dead!    Sibyl    dead!    It    is    not    true!    It    is    a    horrible    lie!    How    dare    you    say    it?” 2017 2016  “It    is    quite    true,    Dorian,”    said    Lord    Henry,    gravely.    “It    is    in    all    the    morning    papers.    I    wrote    down    to    you    to    ask 2018 2017  you    not    to    see    any    one    till    I    came.    There    will    have    to    be    an    inquest,    of    course,    and    you    must    not    be    mixed    up    in 2019 2018  it.    Things    like    that    make    a    man    fashionable    in    Paris.    But    in    London    people    are    so    prejudiced.    Here,    one    should 2020 2019  never    make    one’s    début    with    a    scandal.    One    should    reserve    that    to    give    an    interest    to    one’s    old    age.    I    suppose 2021 2020  they    don’t    know    your    name    at    the    theatre?    If    they    don’t,    it    is    all    right.    Did    any    one    see    you    going    round    to    her 2022 2021  room?    That    is    an    important    point.” 2023 2022  Dorian    did    not    answer    for    a    few    moments.    He    was    dazed    with    horror.    Finally    he    stammered,    in    a    stiﬂed    voice, 2024 2023  “Harry,    did    you    say    an    inquest?    What    did    you    mean    by    that?    Did    Sibyl—?    Oh,    Harry,    I    can’t    bear    it!    But    be    quick. 2025 2024  Tell    me    everything    at    once.” 2026 2025  “I    have    no    doubt    it    was    not    an    accident,    Dorian,    though    it    must    be    put    in    that    way    to    the    public.    It    seems    that 2027 2026  as    she    was    leaving    the    theatre    with    her    mother,    about    half-past    twelve    or    so,    she    said    she    had    forgotten 2028 2027  something    upstairs.    They    waited    some    time    for    her,    but    she    did    not    come    down    again.    They    ultimately    found    her 2029 2028  lying    dead    on    the    ﬂoor    of    her    dressing-room.    She    had    swallowed    something    by    mistake,    some    dreadful    thing 2030 2029  they    use    at    theatres.    I    don’t    know    what    it    was,    but    it    had    either    prussic    acid    or    white    lead    in    it.    I    should    fancy    it 2031 2030  was    prussic    acid,    as    she    seems    to    have    died    instantaneously.” 2032 2031  “Harry,    Harry,    it    is    terrible!”    cried    the    lad. 2033 2032  “Yes;    it    is    very    tragic,    of    course,    but    you    must    not    get    yourself    mixed    up    in    it.    I    see    by    The    Standard    that    she 2034 2033  was    seventeen.    I    should    have    thought    she    was    almost    younger    than    that.    She    looked    such    a    child,    and    seemed 2035 2034  to    know    so    little    about    acting.    Dorian,    you    mustn’t    let    this    thing    get    on    your    nerves.    You    must    come    and    dine    with 2036 2035  me,    and    afterwards    we    will    look    in    at    the    opera.    It    is    a    Patti    night,    and    everybody    will    be    there.    You    can    come    to 2037 2036  my    sister’s    box.    She    has    got    some    smart    women    with    her.” 2038 2037  “So    I    have    murdered    Sibyl    Vane,”    said    Dorian    Gray,    half    to    himself,    “murdered    her    as    surely    as    if    I    had    cut    her 2039 2038  little    throat    with    a    knife.    Yet    the    roses    are    not    less    lovely    for    all    that.    The    birds    sing    just    as    happily    in    my    garde 2040 2039  And    to-night    I    am    to    dine    with    you,    and    then    go    on    to    the    opera,    and    sup    somewhere,    I    suppose,    afterwards. 2041 2040  How    extraordinarily    dramatic    life    is!    If    I    had    read    all    this    in    a    book,    Harry,    I    think    I    would    have    wept    over    it. 2042 2041  Somehow,    now    that    it    has    happened    actually,    and    to    me,    it    seems    far    too    wonderful    for    tears.    Here    is    the    ﬁrst 2043 2042  passionate    love-letter    I    have    ever    written    in    my    life.    Strange,    that    my    ﬁrst    passionate    love-letter    should    have 2044 2043  been    addressed    to    a    dead    girl.    Can    they    feel,    I    wonder,    those    white    silent    people    we    call    the    dead?    Sibyl!    Can 2045 2044  she    feel,    or    know,    or    listen?    Oh,    Harry,    how    I    loved    her    once!    It    seems    years    ago    to    me    now.    She    was 2046 2045  everything    to    me.    Then    came    that    dreadful    night—was    it    really    only    last    night?—when    she    played    so    badly,    and 2047 2046  \\x0cmy    heart    almost    broke.    She    explained    it    all    to    me.    It    was    terribly    pathetic.    But    I    was    not    moved    a    bit.    I    thought 2048 2047  her    shallow.    Suddenly    something    happened    that    made    me    afraid.    I    can’t    tell    you    what    it    was,    but    it    was    terrible.    I 2049 2048  said    I    would    go    back    to    her.    I    felt    I    had    done    wrong.    And    now    she    is    dead.    My    God!    My    God!    Harry,    what    shall    I 2050 2049  do?    You    don’t    know    the    danger    I    am    in,    and    there    is    nothing    to    keep    me    straight.    She    would    have    done    that    for 2051 2050  me.    She    had    no    right    to    kill    herself.    It    was    selfish    of    her.” 2052 2051  “My    dear    Dorian,”    answered    Lord    Henry,    taking    a    cigarette    from    his    case    and    producing    a    gold-latten 2053 2052  matchbox,    “the    only    way    a    woman    can    ever    reform    a    man    is    by    boring    him    so    completely    that    he    loses    all 2054 2053  possible    interest    in    life.    If    you    had    married    this    girl,    you    would    have    been    wretched.    Of    course,    you    would    have 2055 2054  treated    her    kindly.    One    can    always    be    kind    to    people    about    whom    one    cares    nothing.    But    she    would    have    soon 2056 2055  found    out    that    you    were    absolutely    indiﬀerent    to    her.    And    when    a    woman    ﬁnds    that    out    about    her    husband,    she 2057 2056  either    becomes    dreadfully    dowdy,    or    wears    very    smart    bonnets    that    some    other    woman’s    husband    has    to    pay 2058 2057  for.    I    say    nothing    about    the    social    mistake,    which    would    have    been    abject—which,    of    course,    I    would    not    have 2059 2058  allowed—but    I    assure    you    that    in    any    case    the    whole    thing    would    have    been    an    absolute    failure.” 2060 2059  “I    suppose    it    would,”    muttered    the    lad,    walking    up    and    down    the    room    and    looking    horribly    pale.    “But    I    thought 2061 2060  it    was    my    duty.    It    is    not    my    fault    that    this    terrible    tragedy    has    prevented    my    doing    what    was    right.    I    remember 2062 2061  your    saying    once    that    there    is    a    fatality    about    good    resolutions—that    they    are    always    made    too    late.    Mine 2063 2062  certainly    were.” 2064 2063  “Good    resolutions    are    useless    attempts    to    interfere    with    scientiﬁc    laws.    Their    origin    is    pure    vanity.    Their    result 2065 2064  is    absolutely    nil.    They    give    us,    now    and    then,    some    of    those    luxurious    sterile    emotions    that    have    a    certain    charm 2066 2065  for    the    weak.    That    is    all    that    can    be    said    for    them.    They    are    simply    cheques    that    men    draw    on    a    bank    where 2067 2066  they    have    no    account.” 2068 2067  “Harry,”    cried    Dorian    Gray,    coming    over    and    sitting    down    beside    him,    “why    is    it    that    I    cannot    feel    this    tragedy 2069 2068  as    much    as    I    want    to?    I    don’t    think    I    am    heartless.    Do    you?” 2070 2069  “You    have    done    too    many    foolish    things    during    the    last    fortnight    to    be    entitled    to    give    yourself    that    name, 2071 2070  Dorian,”    answered    Lord    Henry    with    his    sweet    melancholy    smile. 2072 2071  The    lad    frowned.    “I    don’t    like    that    explanation,    Harry,”    he    rejoined,    “but    I    am    glad    you    don’t    think    I    am 2073 2072  heartless.    I    am    nothing    of    the    kind.    I    know    I    am    not.    And    yet    I    must    admit    that    this    thing    that    has    happened    does 2074 2073  not    aﬀect    me    as    it    should.    It    seems    to    me    to    be    simply    like    a    wonderful    ending    to    a    wonderful    play.    It    has    all    the 2075 2074  terrible    beauty    of    a    Greek    tragedy,    a    tragedy    in    which    I    took    a    great    part,    but    by    which    I    have    not    been 2076 2075  wounded.” 2077 2076  “It    is    an    interesting    question,”    said    Lord    Henry,    who    found    an    exquisite    pleasure    in    playing    on    the    lad’s 2078 2077  unconscious    egotism,    “an    extremely    interesting    question.    I    fancy    that    the    true    explanation    is    this:    It    often 2079 2078  happens    that    the    real    tragedies    of    life    occur    in    such    an    inartistic    manner    that    they    hurt    us    by    their    crude 2080 2079  violence,    their    absolute    incoherence,    their    absurd    want    of    meaning,    their    entire    lack    of    style.    They    aﬀect    us    just 2081 2080  as    vulgarity    aﬀects    us.    They    give    us    an    impression    of    sheer    brute    force,    and    we    revolt    against    that.    Sometimes, 2082 2081  however,    a    tragedy    that    possesses    artistic    elements    of    beauty    crosses    our    lives.    If    these    elements    of    beauty    are 2083 2082  real,    the    whole    thing    simply    appeals    to    our    sense    of    dramatic    eﬀect.    Suddenly    we    ﬁnd    that    we    are    no    longer    the 2084 2083  actors,    but    the    spectators    of    the    play.    Or    rather    we    are    both.    We    watch    ourselves,    and    the    mere    wonder    of    the 2085 2084  spectacle    enthralls    us.    In    the    present    case,    what    is    it    that    has    really    happened?    Some    one    has    killed    herself    for 2086 2085  love    of    you.    I    wish    that    I    had    ever    had    such    an    experience.    It    would    have    made    me    in    love    with    love    for    the    rest 2087 2086  of    my    life.    The    people    who    have    adored    me—there    have    not    been    very    many,    but    there    have    been    some—have 2088 2087  always    insisted    on    living    on,    long    after    I    had    ceased    to    care    for    them,    or    they    to    care    for    me.    They    have    become 2089 2088  stout    and    tedious,    and    when    I    meet    them,    they    go    in    at    once    for    reminiscences.    That    awful    memory    of    woman! 2090 2089  What    a    fearful    thing    it    is!    And    what    an    utter    intellectual    stagnation    it    reveals!    One    should    absorb    the    colour    of    life, 2091 2090  but    one    should    never    remember    its    details.    Details    are    always    vulgar.” 2092 2091  “I    must    sow    poppies    in    my    garden,”    sighed    Dorian. 2093 2092  “There    is    no    necessity,”    rejoined    his    companion.    “Life    has    always    poppies    in    her    hands.    Of    course,    now    and 2094 2093  then    things    linger.    I    once    wore    nothing    but    violets    all    through    one    season,    as    a    form    of    artistic    mourning    for    a 2095 2094  romance    that    would    not    die.    Ultimately,    however,    it    did    die.    I    forget    what    killed    it.    I    think    it    was    her    proposing    to 2096 2095  sacriﬁce    the    whole    world    for    me.    That    is    always    a    dreadful    moment.    It    ﬁlls    one    with    the    terror    of    eternity.    Well— 2097 2096  would    you    believe    it?—a    week    ago,    at    Lady    Hampshire’s,    I    found    myself    seated    at    dinner    next    the    lady    in 2098 2097  question,    and    she    insisted    on    going    over    the    whole    thing    again,    and    digging    up    the    past,    and    raking    up    the 2099 2098  future.    I    had    buried    my    romance    in    a    bed    of    asphodel.    She    dragged    it    out    again    and    assured    me    that    I    had 2100 2099  spoiled    her    life.    I    am    bound    to    state    that    she    ate    an    enormous    dinner,    so    I    did    not    feel    any    anxiety.    But    what    a 2101 2100  lack    of    taste    she    showed!    The    one    charm    of    the    past    is    that    it    is    the    past.    But    women    never    know    when    the 2102 2101  curtain    has    fallen.    They    always    want    a    sixth    act,    and    as    soon    as    the    interest    of    the    play    is    entirely    over,    they 2103 2102  propose    to    continue    it.    If    they    were    allowed    their    own    way,    every    comedy    would    have    a    tragic    ending,    and    every 2104 2103  tragedy    would    culminate    in    a    farce.    They    are    charmingly    artiﬁcial,    but    they    have    no    sense    of    art.    You    are    more 2105 2104  fortunate    than    I    am.    I    assure    you,    Dorian,    that    not    one    of    the    women    I    have    known    would    have    done    for    me    what 2106 2105  Sibyl    Vane    did    for    you.    Ordinary    women    always    console    themselves.    Some    of    them    do    it    by    going    in    for 2107 2106  sentimental    colours.    Never    trust    a    woman    who    wears    mauve,    whatever    her    age    may    be,    or    a    woman    over    thirty- 2108 2107  ﬁve    who    is    fond    of    pink    ribbons.    It    always    means    that    they    have    a    history.    Others    ﬁnd    a    great    consolation    in 2109 2108  suddenly    discovering    the    good    qualities    of    their    husbands.    They    ﬂaunt    their    conjugal    felicity    in    one’s    face,    as    if    it 2110 2109  were    the    most    fascinating    of    sins.    Religion    consoles    some.    Its    mysteries    have    all    the    charm    of    a    ﬂirtation,    a 2111 2110  woman    once    told    me,    and    I    can    quite    understand    it.    Besides,    nothing    makes    one    so    vain    as    being    told    that    one 2112 2111  is    a    sinner.    Conscience    makes    egotists    of    us    all.    Yes;    there    is    really    no    end    to    the    consolations    that    women    ﬁnd 2113 2112  in    modern    life.    Indeed,    I    have    not    mentioned    the    most    important    one.” 2114 2113  “What    is    that,    Harry?”    said    the    lad    listlessly. 2115 2114  “Oh,    the    obvious    consolation.    Taking    some    one    else’s    admirer    when    one    loses    one’s    own.    In    good    society 2116 2115  that    always    whitewashes    a    woman.    But    really,    Dorian,    how    diﬀerent    Sibyl    Vane    must    have    been    from    all    the 2117 2116  women    one    meets!    There    is    something    to    me    quite    beautiful    about    her    death.    I    am    glad    I    am    living    in    a    century 2118 2117  \\x0cwhen    such    wonders    happen.    They    make    one    believe    in    the    reality    of    the    things    we    all    play    with,    such    as 2119 2118  romance,    passion,    and    love.” 2120 2119  “I    was    terribly    cruel    to    her.    You    forget    that.” 2121 2120  “I    am    afraid    that    women    appreciate    cruelty,    downright    cruelty,    more    than    anything    else.    They    have    wonderfully 2122 2121  primitive    instincts.    We    have    emancipated    them,    but    they    remain    slaves    looking    for    their    masters,    all    the    same. 2123 2122  They    love    being    dominated.    I    am    sure    you    were    splendid.    I    have    never    seen    you    really    and    absolutely    angry, 2124 2123  but    I    can    fancy    how    delightful    you    looked.    And,    after    all,    you    said    something    to    me    the    day    before    yesterday    that 2125 2124  seemed    to    me    at    the    time    to    be    merely    fanciful,    but    that    I    see    now    was    absolutely    true,    and    it    holds    the    key    to 2126 2125  everything.” 2127 2126  “What    was    that,    Harry?” 2128 2127  “You    said    to    me    that    Sibyl    Vane    represented    to    you    all    the    heroines    of    romance—that    she    was    Desdemona 2129 2128  one    night,    and    Ophelia    the    other;    that    if    she    died    as    Juliet,    she    came    to    life    as    Imogen.” 2130 2129  “She    will    never    come    to    life    again    now,”    muttered    the    lad,    burying    his    face    in    his    hands. 2131 2130  “No,    she    will    never    come    to    life.    She    has    played    her    last    part.    But    you    must    think    of    that    lonely    death    in    the 2132 2131  tawdry    dressing-room    simply    as    a    strange    lurid    fragment    from    some    Jacobean    tragedy,    as    a    wonderful    scene 2133 2132  from    Webster,    or    Ford,    or    Cyril    Tourneur.    The    girl    never    really    lived,    and    so    she    has    never    really    died.    To    you    at 2134 2133  least    she    was    always    a    dream,    a    phantom    that    ﬂitted    through    Shakespeare’s    plays    and    left    them    lovelier    for    its 2135 2134  presence,    a    reed    through    which    Shakespeare’s    music    sounded    richer    and    more    full    of    joy.    The    moment    she 2136 2135  touched    actual    life,    she    marred    it,    and    it    marred    her,    and    so    she    passed    away.    Mourn    for    Ophelia,    if    you    like.    Put 2137 2136  ashes    on    your    head    because    Cordelia    was    strangled.    Cry    out    against    Heaven    because    the    daughter    of 2138 2137  Brabantio    died.    But    don’t    waste    your    tears    over    Sibyl    Vane.    She    was    less    real    than    they    are.” 2139 2138  There    was    a    silence.    The    evening    darkened    in    the    room.    Noiselessly,    and    with    silver    feet,    the    shadows    crept 2140 2139  in    from    the    garden.    The    colours    faded    wearily    out    of    things. 2141 2140  After    some    time    Dorian    Gray    looked    up.    “You    have    explained    me    to    myself,    Harry,”    he    murmured    with 2142 2141  something    of    a    sigh    of    relief.    “I    felt    all    that    you    have    said,    but    somehow    I    was    afraid    of    it,    and    I    could    not    expres 2143 2142  it    to    myself.    How    well    you    know    me!    But    we    will    not    talk    again    of    what    has    happened.    It    has    been    a    marvellous 2144 2143  experience.    That    is    all.    I    wonder    if    life    has    still    in    store    for    me    anything    as    marvellous.” 2145 2144  “Life    has    everything    in    store    for    you,    Dorian.    There    is    nothing    that    you,    with    your    extraordinary    good    looks,    will 2146 2145  not    be    able    to    do.” 2147 2146  “But    suppose,    Harry,    I    became    haggard,    and    old,    and    wrinkled?    What    then?” 2148 2147  “Ah,    then,”    said    Lord    Henry,    rising    to    go,    “then,    my    dear    Dorian,    you    would    have    to    ﬁght    for    your    victories.    As    it 2149 2148  is,    they    are    brought    to    you.    No,    you    must    keep    your    good    looks.    We    live    in    an    age    that    reads    too    much    to    be 2150 2149  wise,    and    that    thinks    too    much    to    be    beautiful.    We    cannot    spare    you.    And    now    you    had    better    dress    and    drive 2151 2150  down    to    the    club.    We    are    rather    late,    as    it    is.” 2152 2151  “I    think    I    shall    join    you    at    the    opera,    Harry.    I    feel    too    tired    to    eat    anything.    What    is    the    number    of    your    sister’s 2153 2152  box?” 2154 2153  “Twenty-seven,    I    believe.    It    is    on    the    grand    tier.    You    will    see    her    name    on    the    door.    But    I    am    sorry    you    won’t 2155 2154  come    and    dine.” 2156 2155  “I    don’t    feel    up    to    it,”    said    Dorian    listlessly.    “But    I    am    awfully    obliged    to    you    for    all    that    you    have    said    to    me. 2157 2156  You    are    certainly    my    best    friend.    No    one    has    ever    understood    me    as    you    have.” 2158 2157  “We    are    only    at    the    beginning    of    our    friendship,    Dorian,”    answered    Lord    Henry,    shaking    him    by    the    hand. 2159 2158  “Good-bye.    I    shall    see    you    before    nine-thirty,    I    hope.    Remember,    Patti    is    singing.” 2160 2159  As    he    closed    the    door    behind    him,    Dorian    Gray    touched    the    bell,    and    in    a    few    minutes    Victor    appeared    with 2161 2160  the    lamps    and    drew    the    blinds    down.    He    waited    impatiently    for    him    to    go.    The    man    seemed    to    take    an 2162 2161  interminable    time    over    everything. 2163 2162  As    soon    as    he    had    left,    he    rushed    to    the    screen    and    drew    it    back.    No;    there    was    no    further    change    in    the 2164 2163  picture.    It    had    received    the    news    of    Sibyl    Vane’s    death    before    he    had    known    of    it    himself.    It    was    conscious    of 2165 2164  the    events    of    life    as    they    occurred.    The    vicious    cruelty    that    marred    the    ﬁne    lines    of    the    mouth    had,    no    doubt, 2166 2165  appeared    at    the    very    moment    that    the    girl    had    drunk    the    poison,    whatever    it    was.    Or    was    it    indiﬀerent    to    results? 2167 2166  Did    it    merely    take    cognizance    of    what    passed    within    the    soul?    He    wondered,    and    hoped    that    some    day    he    would 2168 2167  see    the    change    taking    place    before    his    very    eyes,    shuddering    as    he    hoped    it. 2169 2168  Poor    Sibyl!    What    a    romance    it    had    all    been!    She    had    often    mimicked    death    on    the    stage.    Then    Death    himself 2170 2169  had    touched    her    and    taken    her    with    him.    How    had    she    played    that    dreadful    last    scene?    Had    she    cursed    him,    as 2171 2170  she    died?    No;    she    had    died    for    love    of    him,    and    love    would    always    be    a    sacrament    to    him    now.    She    had    atoned 2172 2171  for    everything    by    the    sacriﬁce    she    had    made    of    her    life.    He    would    not    think    any    more    of    what    she    had    made    him 2173 2172  go    through,    on    that    horrible    night    at    the    theatre.    When    he    thought    of    her,    it    would    be    as    a    wonderful    tragic    ﬁgure 2174 2173  sent    on    to    the    world’s    stage    to    show    the    supreme    reality    of    love.    A    wonderful    tragic    ﬁgure?    Tears    came    to    his 2175 2174  eyes    as    he    remembered    her    childlike    look,    and    winsome    fanciful    ways,    and    shy    tremulous    grace.    He    brushed 2176 2175  them    away    hastily    and    looked    again    at    the    picture. 2177 2176  He    felt    that    the    time    had    really    come    for    making    his    choice.    Or    had    his    choice    already    been    made?    Yes,    life 2178 2177  had    decided    that    for    him—life,    and    his    own    inﬁnite    curiosity    about    life.    Eternal    youth,    inﬁnite    passion,    pleasures 2179 2178  subtle    and    secret,    wild    joys    and    wilder    sins—he    was    to    have    all    these    things.    The    portrait    was    to    bear    the 2180 2179  burden    of    his    shame:    that    was    all. 2181 2180  A    feeling    of    pain    crept    over    him    as    he    thought    of    the    desecration    that    was    in    store    for    the    fair    face    on    the 2182 2181  canvas.    Once,    in    boyish    mockery    of    Narcissus,    he    had    kissed,    or    feigned    to    kiss,    those    painted    lips    that    now 2183 2182  smiled    so    cruelly    at    him.    Morning    after    morning    he    had    sat    before    the    portrait    wondering    at    its    beauty,    almost 2184 2183  enamoured    of    it,    as    it    seemed    to    him    at    times.    Was    it    to    alter    now    with    every    mood    to    which    he    yielded?    Was    it 2185 2184  to    become    a    monstrous    and    loathsome    thing,    to    be    hidden    away    in    a    locked    room,    to    be    shut    out    from    the 2186 2185  sunlight    that    had    so    often    touched    to    brighter    gold    the    waving    wonder    of    its    hair?    The    pity    of    it!    the    pity    of    it! 2187 2186  \\x0c            For    a    moment,    he    thought    of    praying    that    the    horrible    sympathy    that    existed    between    him    and    the    picture 2188 2187  might    cease.    It    had    changed    in    answer    to    a    prayer;    perhaps    in    answer    to    a    prayer    it    might    remain    unchanged. 2189 2188  And    yet,    who,    that    knew    anything    about    life,    would    surrender    the    chance    of    remaining    always    young,    however 2190 2189  fantastic    that    chance    might    be,    or    with    what    fateful    consequences    it    might    be    fraught?    Besides,    was    it    really 2191 2190  under    his    control?    Had    it    indeed    been    prayer    that    had    produced    the    substitution?    Might    there    not    be    some 2192 2191  curious    scientiﬁc    reason    for    it    all?    If    thought    could    exercise    its    inﬂuence    upon    a    living    organism,    might    not 2193 2192  thought    exercise    an    inﬂuence    upon    dead    and    inorganic    things?    Nay,    without    thought    or    conscious    desire,    might 2194 2193  not    things    external    to    ourselves    vibrate    in    unison    with    our    moods    and    passions,    atom    calling    to    atom    in    secret 2195 2194  love    or    strange    aﬃnity?    But    the    reason    was    of    no    importance.    He    would    never    again    tempt    by    a    prayer    any 2196 2195  terrible    power.    If    the    picture    was    to    alter,    it    was    to    alter.    That    was    all.    Why    inquire    too    closely    into    it? 2197 2196  For    there    would    be    a    real    pleasure    in    watching    it.    He    would    be    able    to    follow    his    mind    into    its    secret    places. 2198 2197  This    portrait    would    be    to    him    the    most    magical    of    mirrors.    As    it    had    revealed    to    him    his    own    body,    so    it    would 2199 2198  reveal    to    him    his    own    soul.    And    when    winter    came    upon    it,    he    would    still    be    standing    where    spring    trembles    on 2200 2199  the    verge    of    summer.    When    the    blood    crept    from    its    face,    and    left    behind    a    pallid    mask    of    chalk    with    leaden 2201 2200  eyes,    he    would    keep    the    glamour    of    boyhood.    Not    one    blossom    of    his    loveliness    would    ever    fade.    Not    one    pulse 2202 2201  of    his    life    would    ever    weaken.    Like    the    gods    of    the    Greeks,    he    would    be    strong,    and    fleet,    and    joyous.    What    did    it 2203 2202  matter    what    happened    to    the    coloured    image    on    the    canvas?    He    would    be    safe.    That    was    everything. 2204 2203  He    drew    the    screen    back    into    its    former    place    in    front    of    the    picture,    smiling    as    he    did    so,    and    passed    into    his 2205 2204  bedroom,    where    his    valet    was    already    waiting    for    him.    An    hour    later    he    was    at    the    opera,    and    Lord    Henry    was 2206 2205  leaning    over    his    chair. 2207 2206  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                                CHAPTER    IX. 2208 2207  As    he    was    sitting    at    breakfast    next    morning,    Basil    Hallward    was    shown    into    the    room. 2209 2208  “I    am    so    glad    I    have    found    you,    Dorian,”    he    said    gravely.    “I    called    last    night,    and    they    told    me    you    were    at    the 2210 2209  opera.    Of    course,    I    knew    that    was    impossible.    But    I    wish    you    had    left    word    where    you    had    really    gone    to.    I 2211 2210  passed    a    dreadful    evening,    half    afraid    that    one    tragedy    might    be    followed    by    another.    I    think    you    might    have 2212 2211  telegraphed    for    me    when    you    heard    of    it    ﬁrst.    I    read    of    it    quite    by    chance    in    a    late    edition    of    The    Globe    that    I 2213 2212  picked    up    at    the    club.    I    came    here    at    once    and    was    miserable    at    not    ﬁnding    you.    I    can’t    tell    you    how    heart- 2214 2213  broken    I    am    about    the    whole    thing.    I    know    what    you    must    suﬀer.    But    where    were    you?    Did    you    go    down    and    see 2215 2214  the    girl’s    mother?    For    a    moment    I    thought    of    following    you    there.    They    gave    the    address    in    the    paper. 2216 2215  Somewhere    in    the    Euston    Road,    isn’t    it?    But    I    was    afraid    of    intruding    upon    a    sorrow    that    I    could    not    lighten.    Poor 2217 2216  woman!    What    a    state    she    must    be    in!    And    her    only    child,    too!    What    did    she    say    about    it    all?” 2218 2217  “My    dear    Basil,    how    do    I    know?”    murmured    Dorian    Gray,    sipping    some    pale-yellow    wine    from    a    delicate,    gold- 2219 2218  beaded    bubble    of    Venetian    glass    and    looking    dreadfully    bored.    “I    was    at    the    opera.    You    should    have    come    on 2220 2219  there.    I    met    Lady    Gwendolen,    Harry’s    sister,    for    the    ﬁrst    time.    We    were    in    her    box.    She    is    perfectly    charming; 2221 2220  and    Patti    sang    divinely.    Don’t    talk    about    horrid    subjects.    If    one    doesn’t    talk    about    a    thing,    it    has    never    happened. 2222 2221  It    is    simply    expression,    as    Harry    says,    that    gives    reality    to    things.    I    may    mention    that    she    was    not    the    woman’s 2223 2222  only    child.    There    is    a    son,    a    charming    fellow,    I    believe.    But    he    is    not    on    the    stage.    He    is    a    sailor,    or    something. 2224 2223  And    now,    tell    me    about    yourself    and    what    you    are    painting.” 2225 2224  “You    went    to    the    opera?”    said    Hallward,    speaking    very    slowly    and    with    a    strained    touch    of    pain    in    his    voice. 2226 2225  “You    went    to    the    opera    while    Sibyl    Vane    was    lying    dead    in    some    sordid    lodging?    You    can    talk    to    me    of    other 2227 2226  women    being    charming,    and    of    Patti    singing    divinely,    before    the    girl    you    loved    has    even    the    quiet    of    a    grave    to 2228 2227  sleep    in?    Why,    man,    there    are    horrors    in    store    for    that    little    white    body    of    hers!” 2229 2228  “Stop,    Basil!    I    won’t    hear    it!”    cried    Dorian,    leaping    to    his    feet.    “You    must    not    tell    me    about    things.    What    is    done 2230 2229  is    done.    What    is    past    is    past.” 2231 2230  “You    call    yesterday    the    past?” 2232 2231  “What    has    the    actual    lapse    of    time    got    to    do    with    it?    It    is    only    shallow    people    who    require    years    to    get    rid    of    an 2233 2232  emotion.    A    man    who    is    master    of    himself    can    end    a    sorrow    as    easily    as    he    can    invent    a    pleasure.    I    don’t    want    to 2234 2233  be    at    the    mercy    of    my    emotions.    I    want    to    use    them,    to    enjoy    them,    and    to    dominate    them.” 2235 2234  “Dorian,    this    is    horrible!    Something    has    changed    you    completely.    You    look    exactly    the    same    wonderful    boy 2236 2235  who,    day    after    day,    used    to    come    down    to    my    studio    to    sit    for    his    picture.    But    you    were    simple,    natural,    and 2237 2236  aﬀectionate    then.    You    were    the    most    unspoiled    creature    in    the    whole    world.    Now,    I    don’t    know    what    has    come 2238 2237  over    you.    You    talk    as    if    you    had    no    heart,    no    pity    in    you.    It    is    all    Harry’s    influence.    I    see    that.” 2239 2238  The    lad    ﬂushed    up    and,    going    to    the    window,    looked    out    for    a    few    moments    on    the    green,    ﬂickering,    sun- 2240 2239  lashed    garden.    “I    owe    a    great    deal    to    Harry,    Basil,”    he    said    at    last,    “more    than    I    owe    to    you.    You    only    taught    me 2241 2240  to    be    vain.” 2242 2241  “Well,    I    am    punished    for    that,    Dorian—or    shall    be    some    day.” 2243 2242  “I    don’t    know    what    you    mean,    Basil,”    he    exclaimed,    turning    round.    “I    don’t    know    what    you    want.    What    do    you 2244 2243  want?” 2245 2244  “I    want    the    Dorian    Gray    I    used    to    paint,”    said    the    artist    sadly. 2246 2245  “Basil,”    said    the    lad,    going    over    to    him    and    putting    his    hand    on    his    shoulder,    “you    have    come    too    late. 2247 2246  Yesterday,    when    I    heard    that    Sibyl    Vane    had    killed    herself—” 2248 2247  “Killed    herself!    Good    heavens!    is    there    no    doubt    about    that?”    cried    Hallward,    looking    up    at    him    with    an 2249 2248  expression    of    horror. 2250 2249  “My    dear    Basil!    Surely    you    don’t    think    it    was    a    vulgar    accident?    Of    course    she    killed    herself.” 2251 2250  The    elder    man    buried    his    face    in    his    hands.    “How    fearful,”    he    muttered,    and    a    shudder    ran    through    him. 2252 2251  “No,”    said    Dorian    Gray,    “there    is    nothing    fearful    about    it.    It    is    one    of    the    great    romantic    tragedies    of    the    age. 2253 2252  As    a    rule,    people    who    act    lead    the    most    commonplace    lives.    They    are    good    husbands,    or    faithful    wives,    or 2254 2253  something    tedious.    You    know    what    I    mean—middle-class    virtue    and    all    that    kind    of    thing.    How    diﬀerent    Sibyl 2255 2254  was!    She    lived    her    ﬁnest    tragedy.    She    was    always    a    heroine.    The    last    night    she    played—the    night    you    saw    her 2256 2255  —she    acted    badly    because    she    had    known    the    reality    of    love.    When    she    knew    its    unreality,    she    died,    as    Juliet 2257 2256  might    have    died.    She    passed    again    into    the    sphere    of    art.    There    is    something    of    the    martyr    about    her.    Her    death 2258 2257  has    all    the    pathetic    uselessness    of    martyrdom,    all    its    wasted    beauty.    But,    as    I    was    saying,    you    must    not    think    I 2259 2258  have    not    suﬀered.    If    you    had    come    in    yesterday    at    a    particular    moment—about    half-past    ﬁve,    perhaps,    or    a 2260 2259  quarter    to    six—you    would    have    found    me    in    tears.    Even    Harry,    who    was    here,    who    brought    me    the    news,    in 2261 2260  fact,    had    no    idea    what    I    was    going    through.    I    suﬀered    immensely.    Then    it    passed    away.    I    cannot    repeat    an 2262 2261  emotion.    No    one    can,    except    sentimentalists.    And    you    are    awfully    unjust,    Basil.    You    come    down    here    to    console 2263 2262  me.    That    is    charming    of    you.    You    ﬁnd    me    consoled,    and    you    are    furious.    How    like    a    sympathetic    person!    You 2264 2263  remind    me    of    a    story    Harry    told    me    about    a    certain    philanthropist    who    spent    twenty    years    of    his    life    in    trying    to 2265 2264  get    some    grievance    redressed,    or    some    unjust    law    altered—I    forget    exactly    what    it    was.    Finally    he    succeeded, 2266 2265  and    nothing    could    exceed    his    disappointment.    He    had    absolutely    nothing    to    do,    almost    died    of    ennui,    and 2267 2266  became    a    conﬁrmed    misanthrope.    And    besides,    my    dear    old    Basil,    if    you    really    want    to    console    me,    teach    me 2268 2267  rather    to    forget    what    has    happened,    or    to    see    it    from    a    proper    artistic    point    of    view.    Was    it    not    Gautier    who    used 2269 2268  to    write    about    la    consolation    des    arts?    I    remember    picking    up    a    little    vellum-covered    book    in    your    studio    one    day 2270 2269  and    chancing    on    that    delightful    phrase.    Well,    I    am    not    like    that    young    man    you    told    me    of    when    we    were    down    at 2271 2270  Marlow    together,    the    young    man    who    used    to    say    that    yellow    satin    could    console    one    for    all    the    miseries    of    life.    I 2272 2271  love    beautiful    things    that    one    can    touch    and    handle.    Old    brocades,    green    bronzes,    lacquer-work,    carved    ivories, 2273 2272  exquisite    surroundings,    luxury,    pomp—there    is    much    to    be    got    from    all    these.    But    the    artistic    temperament    that 2274 2273  they    create,    or    at    any    rate    reveal,    is    still    more    to    me.    To    become    the    spectator    of    one’s    own    life,    as    Harry    says, 2275 2274  \\x0cis    to    escape    the    suﬀering    of    life.    I    know    you    are    surprised    at    my    talking    to    you    like    this.    You    have    not    realized 2276 2275  how    I    have    developed.    I    was    a    schoolboy    when    you    knew    me.    I    am    a    man    now.    I    have    new    passions,    new 2277 2276  thoughts,    new    ideas.    I    am    diﬀerent,    but    you    must    not    like    me    less.    I    am    changed,    but    you    must    always    be    my 2278 2277  friend.    Of    course,    I    am    very    fond    of    Harry.    But    I    know    that    you    are    better    than    he    is.    You    are    not    stronger—you 2279 2278  are    too    much    afraid    of    life—but    you    are    better.    And    how    happy    we    used    to    be    together!    Don’t    leave    me,    Basil, 2280 2279  and    don’t    quarrel    with    me.    I    am    what    I    am.    There    is    nothing    more    to    be    said.” 2281 2280  The    painter    felt    strangely    moved.    The    lad    was    inﬁnitely    dear    to    him,    and    his    personality    had    been    the    great 2282 2281  turning    point    in    his    art.    He    could    not    bear    the    idea    of    reproaching    him    any    more.    After    all,    his    indiﬀerence    was 2283 2282  probably    merely    a    mood    that    would    pass    away.    There    was    so    much    in    him    that    was    good,    so    much    in    him    that 2284 2283  was    noble. 2285 2284  “Well,    Dorian,”    he    said    at    length,    with    a    sad    smile,    “I    won’t    speak    to    you    again    about    this    horrible    thing,    after 2286 2285  to-day.    I    only    trust    your    name    won’t    be    mentioned    in    connection    with    it.    The    inquest    is    to    take    place    this 2287 2286  afternoon.    Have    they    summoned    you?” 2288 2287  Dorian    shook    his    head,    and    a    look    of    annoyance    passed    over    his    face    at    the    mention    of    the    word    “inquest.” 2289 2288  There    was    something    so    crude    and    vulgar    about    everything    of    the    kind.    “They    don’t    know    my    name,”    he 2290 2289  answered. 2291 2290  “But    surely    she    did?” 2292 2291  “Only    my    Christian    name,    and    that    I    am    quite    sure    she    never    mentioned    to    any    one.    She    told    me    once    that 2293 2292  they    were    all    rather    curious    to    learn    who    I    was,    and    that    she    invariably    told    them    my    name    was    Prince 2294 2293  Charming.    It    was    pretty    of    her.    You    must    do    me    a    drawing    of    Sibyl,    Basil.    I    should    like    to    have    something    more 2295 2294  of    her    than    the    memory    of    a    few    kisses    and    some    broken    pathetic    words.” 2296 2295  “I    will    try    and    do    something,    Dorian,    if    it    would    please    you.    But    you    must    come    and    sit    to    me    yourself    again.    I 2297 2296  can’t    get    on    without    you.” 2298 2297  “I    can    never    sit    to    you    again,    Basil.    It    is    impossible!”    he    exclaimed,    starting    back. 2299 2298  The    painter    stared    at    him.    “My    dear    boy,    what    nonsense!”    he    cried.    “Do    you    mean    to    say    you    don’t    like    what    I 2300 2299  did    of    you?    Where    is    it?    Why    have    you    pulled    the    screen    in    front    of    it?    Let    me    look    at    it.    It    is    the    best    thing    I 2301 2300  ever    done.    Do    take    the    screen    away,    Dorian.    It    is    simply    disgraceful    of    your    servant    hiding    my    work    like    that.    I 2302 2301  felt    the    room    looked    different    as    I    came    in.” 2303 2302  “My    servant    has    nothing    to    do    with    it,    Basil.    You    don’t    imagine    I    let    him    arrange    my    room    for    me?    He    settles 2304 2303  my    flowers    for    me    sometimes—that    is    all.    No;    I    did    it    myself.    The    light    was    too    strong    on    the    portrait.” 2305 2304  “Too    strong!    Surely    not,    my    dear    fellow?    It    is    an    admirable    place    for    it.    Let    me    see    it.”    And    Hallward    walked 2306 2305  towards    the    corner    of    the    room. 2307 2306  A    cry    of    terror    broke    from    Dorian    Gray’s    lips,    and    he    rushed    between    the    painter    and    the    screen.    “Basil,”    he 2308 2307  said,    looking    very    pale,    “you    must    not    look    at    it.    I    don’t    wish    you    to.” 2309 2308  “Not    look    at    my    own    work!    You    are    not    serious.    Why    shouldn’t    I    look    at    it?”    exclaimed    Hallward,    laughing. 2310 2309  “If    you    try    to    look    at    it,    Basil,    on    my    word    of    honour    I    will    never    speak    to    you    again    as    long    as    I    live.    I    am    qui 2311 2310  serious.    I    don’t    oﬀer    any    explanation,    and    you    are    not    to    ask    for    any.    But,    remember,    if    you    touch    this    screen, 2312 2311  everything    is    over    between    us.” 2313 2312  Hallward    was    thunderstruck.    He    looked    at    Dorian    Gray    in    absolute    amazement.    He    had    never    seen    him    like 2314 2313  this    before.    The    lad    was    actually    pallid    with    rage.    His    hands    were    clenched,    and    the    pupils    of    his    eyes    were    like 2315 2314  disks    of    blue    fire.    He    was    trembling    all    over. 2316 2315  “Dorian!” 2317 2316  “Don’t    speak!” 2318 2317  “But    what    is    the    matter?    Of    course    I    won’t    look    at    it    if    you    don’t    want    me    to,”    he    said,    rather    coldly,    turning    on 2319 2318  his    heel    and    going    over    towards    the    window.    “But,    really,    it    seems    rather    absurd    that    I    shouldn’t    see    my    own 2320 2319  work,    especially    as    I    am    going    to    exhibit    it    in    Paris    in    the    autumn.    I    shall    probably    have    to    give    it    another    coat    of 2321 2320  varnish    before    that,    so    I    must    see    it    some    day,    and    why    not    to-day?” 2322 2321  “To    exhibit    it!    You    want    to    exhibit    it?”    exclaimed    Dorian    Gray,    a    strange    sense    of    terror    creeping    over    him. 2323 2322  Was    the    world    going    to    be    shown    his    secret?    Were    people    to    gape    at    the    mystery    of    his    life?    That    was 2324 2323  impossible.    Something—he    did    not    know    what—had    to    be    done    at    once. 2325 2324  “Yes;    I    don’t    suppose    you    will    object    to    that.    Georges    Petit    is    going    to    collect    all    my    best    pictures    for    a    special 2326 2325  exhibition    in    the    Rue    de    Sèze,    which    will    open    the    ﬁrst    week    in    October.    The    portrait    will    only    be    away    a    month.    I 2327 2326  should    think    you    could    easily    spare    it    for    that    time.    In    fact,    you    are    sure    to    be    out    of    town.    And    if    you    keep    it 2328 2327  always    behind    a    screen,    you    can’t    care    much    about    it.” 2329 2328  Dorian    Gray    passed    his    hand    over    his    forehead.    There    were    beads    of    perspiration    there.    He    felt    that    he    was 2330 2329  on    the    brink    of    a    horrible    danger.    “You    told    me    a    month    ago    that    you    would    never    exhibit    it,”    he    cried.    “Why    have 2331 2330  you    changed    your    mind?    You    people    who    go    in    for    being    consistent    have    just    as    many    moods    as    others    have. 2332 2331  The    only    diﬀerence    is    that    your    moods    are    rather    meaningless.    You    can’t    have    forgotten    that    you    assured    me 2333 2332  most    solemnly    that    nothing    in    the    world    would    induce    you    to    send    it    to    any    exhibition.    You    told    Harry    exactly    the 2334 2333  same    thing.”    He    stopped    suddenly,    and    a    gleam    of    light    came    into    his    eyes.    He    remembered    that    Lord    Henry 2335 2334  had    said    to    him    once,    half    seriously    and    half    in    jest,    “If    you    want    to    have    a    strange    quarter    of    an    hour,    get    Basil 2336 2335  to    tell    you    why    he    won’t    exhibit    your    picture.    He    told    me    why    he    wouldn’t,    and    it    was    a    revelation    to    me.”    Yes, 2337 2336  perhaps    Basil,    too,    had    his    secret.    He    would    ask    him    and    try. 2338 2337  “Basil,”    he    said,    coming    over    quite    close    and    looking    him    straight    in    the    face,    “we    have    each    of    us    a    secret. 2339 2338  Let    me    know    yours,    and    I    shall    tell    you    mine.    What    was    your    reason    for    refusing    to    exhibit    my    picture?” 2340 2339  The    painter    shuddered    in    spite    of    himself.    “Dorian,    if    I    told    you,    you    might    like    me    less    than    you    do,    and    you 2341 2340  would    certainly    laugh    at    me.    I    could    not    bear    your    doing    either    of    those    two    things.    If    you    wish    me    never    to    look 2342 2341  at    your    picture    again,    I    am    content.    I    have    always    you    to    look    at.    If    you    wish    the    best    work    I    have    ever    done    to 2343 2342  be    hidden    from    the    world,    I    am    satisfied.    Your    friendship    is    dearer    to    me    than    any    fame    or    reputation.” 2344 2343  \\x0c                “No,    Basil,    you    must    tell    me,”    insisted    Dorian    Gray.    “I    think    I    have    a    right    to    know.”    His    feeling    of    terror    ha 2345 2344  passed    away,    and    curiosity    had    taken    its    place.    He    was    determined    to    find    out    Basil    Hallward’s    mystery. 2346 2345  “Let    us    sit    down,    Dorian,”    said    the    painter,    looking    troubled.    “Let    us    sit    down.    And    just    answer    me    one 2347 2346  question.    Have    you    noticed    in    the    picture    something    curious?—something    that    probably    at    ﬁrst    did    not    strike 2348 2347  you,    but    that    revealed    itself    to    you    suddenly?” 2349 2348  “Basil!”    cried    the    lad,    clutching    the    arms    of    his    chair    with    trembling    hands    and    gazing    at    him    with    wild    startled 2350 2349  eyes. 2351 2350  “I    see    you    did.    Don’t    speak.    Wait    till    you    hear    what    I    have    to    say.    Dorian,    from    the    moment    I    met    you,    your 2352 2351  personality    had    the    most    extraordinary    inﬂuence    over    me.    I    was    dominated,    soul,    brain,    and    power,    by    you.    You 2353 2352  became    to    me    the    visible    incarnation    of    that    unseen    ideal    whose    memory    haunts    us    artists    like    an    exquisite 2354 2353  dream.    I    worshipped    you.    I    grew    jealous    of    every    one    to    whom    you    spoke.    I    wanted    to    have    you    all    to    myself.    I 2355 2354  was    only    happy    when    I    was    with    you.    When    you    were    away    from    me,    you    were    still    present    in    my    art....    Of 2356 2355  course,    I    never    let    you    know    anything    about    this.    It    would    have    been    impossible.    You    would    not    have    understood 2357 2356  it.    I    hardly    understood    it    myself.    I    only    knew    that    I    had    seen    perfection    face    to    face,    and    that    the    world    had 2358 2357  become    wonderful    to    my    eyes—too    wonderful,    perhaps,    for    in    such    mad    worships    there    is    peril,    the    peril    of 2359 2358  losing    them,    no    less    than    the    peril    of    keeping    them....    Weeks    and    weeks    went    on,    and    I    grew    more    and    more 2360 2359  absorbed    in    you.    Then    came    a    new    development.    I    had    drawn    you    as    Paris    in    dainty    armour,    and    as    Adonis    with 2361 2360  huntsman’s    cloak    and    polished    boar-spear.    Crowned    with    heavy    lotus-blossoms    you    had    sat    on    the    prow    of 2362 2361  Adrian’s    barge,    gazing    across    the    green    turbid    Nile.    You    had    leaned    over    the    still    pool    of    some    Greek    woodland 2363 2362  and    seen    in    the    water’s    silent    silver    the    marvel    of    your    own    face.    And    it    had    all    been    what    art    should    be— 2364 2363  unconscious,    ideal,    and    remote.    One    day,    a    fatal    day    I    sometimes    think,    I    determined    to    paint    a    wonderful 2365 2364  portrait    of    you    as    you    actually    are,    not    in    the    costume    of    dead    ages,    but    in    your    own    dress    and    in    your    own    time. 2366 2365  Whether    it    was    the    realism    of    the    method,    or    the    mere    wonder    of    your    own    personality,    thus    directly    presented 2367 2366  to    me    without    mist    or    veil,    I    cannot    tell.    But    I    know    that    as    I    worked    at    it,    every    ﬂake    and    ﬁlm    of    colour    seemed    to 2368 2367  me    to    reveal    my    secret.    I    grew    afraid    that    others    would    know    of    my    idolatry.    I    felt,    Dorian,    that    I    had    told    too 2369 2368  much,    that    I    had    put    too    much    of    myself    into    it.    Then    it    was    that    I    resolved    never    to    allow    the    picture    to    be 2370 2369  exhibited.    You    were    a    little    annoyed;    but    then    you    did    not    realize    all    that    it    meant    to    me.    Harry,    to    whom    I    talked 2371 2370  about    it,    laughed    at    me.    But    I    did    not    mind    that.    When    the    picture    was    ﬁnished,    and    I    sat    alone    with    it,    I    felt    that 2372 2371  was    right....    Well,    after    a    few    days    the    thing    left    my    studio,    and    as    soon    as    I    had    got    rid    of    the    intolerable 2373 2372  fascination    of    its    presence,    it    seemed    to    me    that    I    had    been    foolish    in    imagining    that    I    had    seen    anything    in    it, 2374 2373  more    than    that    you    were    extremely    good-looking    and    that    I    could    paint.    Even    now    I    cannot    help    feeling    that    it    is 2375 2374  a    mistake    to    think    that    the    passion    one    feels    in    creation    is    ever    really    shown    in    the    work    one    creates.    Art    is 2376 2375  always    more    abstract    than    we    fancy.    Form    and    colour    tell    us    of    form    and    colour—that    is    all.    It    often    seems    to    me 2377 2376  that    art    conceals    the    artist    far    more    completely    than    it    ever    reveals    him.    And    so    when    I    got    this    oﬀer    from    Paris,    I 2378 2377  determined    to    make    your    portrait    the    principal    thing    in    my    exhibition.    It    never    occurred    to    me    that    you    would 2379 2378  refuse.    I    see    now    that    you    were    right.    The    picture    cannot    be    shown.    You    must    not    be    angry    with    me,    Dorian,    for 2380 2379  what    I    have    told    you.    As    I    said    to    Harry,    once,    you    are    made    to    be    worshipped.” 2381 2380  Dorian    Gray    drew    a    long    breath.    The    colour    came    back    to    his    cheeks,    and    a    smile    played    about    his    lips.    The 2382 2381  peril    was    over.    He    was    safe    for    the    time.    Yet    he    could    not    help    feeling    inﬁnite    pity    for    the    painter    who    had    just 2383 2382  made    this    strange    confession    to    him,    and    wondered    if    he    himself    would    ever    be    so    dominated    by    the    personality 2384 2383  of    a    friend.    Lord    Henry    had    the    charm    of    being    very    dangerous.    But    that    was    all.    He    was    too    clever    and    too 2385 2384  cynical    to    be    really    fond    of.    Would    there    ever    be    some    one    who    would    ﬁll    him    with    a    strange    idolatry?    Was    that 2386 2385  one    of    the    things    that    life    had    in    store? 2387 2386  “It    is    extraordinary    to    me,    Dorian,”    said    Hallward,    “that    you    should    have    seen    this    in    the    portrait.    Did    you    really 2388 2387  see    it?” 2389 2388  “I    saw    something    in    it,”    he    answered,    “something    that    seemed    to    me    very    curious.” 2390 2389  “Well,    you    don’t    mind    my    looking    at    the    thing    now?” 2391 2390  Dorian    shook    his    head.    “You    must    not    ask    me    that,    Basil.    I    could    not    possibly    let    you    stand    in    front    of    that 2392 2391  picture.” 2393 2392  “You    will    some    day,    surely?” 2394 2393  “Never.” 2395 2394  “Well,    perhaps    you    are    right.    And    now    good-bye,    Dorian.    You    have    been    the    one    person    in    my    life    who    has 2396 2395  really    inﬂuenced    my    art.    Whatever    I    have    done    that    is    good,    I    owe    to    you.    Ah!    you    don’t    know    what    it    cost    me    to 2397 2396  tell    you    all    that    I    have    told    you.” 2398 2397  “My    dear    Basil,”    said    Dorian,    “what    have    you    told    me?    Simply    that    you    felt    that    you    admired    me    too    much. 2399 2398  That    is    not    even    a    compliment.” 2400 2399  “It    was    not    intended    as    a    compliment.    It    was    a    confession.    Now    that    I    have    made    it,    something    seems    to    have 2401 2400  gone    out    of    me.    Perhaps    one    should    never    put    one’s    worship    into    words.” 2402 2401  “It    was    a    very    disappointing    confession.” 2403 2402  “Why,    what    did    you    expect,    Dorian?    You    didn’t    see    anything    else    in    the    picture,    did    you?    There    was    nothing 2404 2403  else    to    see?” 2405 2404  “No;    there    was    nothing    else    to    see.    Why    do    you    ask?    But    you    mustn’t    talk    about    worship.    It    is    foolish.    You    and 2406 2405  I    are    friends,    Basil,    and    we    must    always    remain    so.” 2407 2406  “You    have    got    Harry,”    said    the    painter    sadly. 2408 2407  “Oh,    Harry!”    cried    the    lad,    with    a    ripple    of    laughter.    “Harry    spends    his    days    in    saying    what    is    incredible    and    his 2409 2408  evenings    in    doing    what    is    improbable.    Just    the    sort    of    life    I    would    like    to    lead.    But    still    I    don’t    think    I    would    go 2410 2409  Harry    if    I    were    in    trouble.    I    would    sooner    go    to    you,    Basil.” 2411 2410  “You    will    sit    to    me    again?” 2412 2411  “Impossible!” 2413 2412  \\x0c            “You    spoil    my    life    as    an    artist    by    refusing,    Dorian.    No    man    comes    across    two    ideal    things.    Few    come    across 2414 2413  one.” 2415 2414  “I    can’t    explain    it    to    you,    Basil,    but    I    must    never    sit    to    you    again.    There    is    something    fatal    about    a    portrait.    It 2416 2415  has    a    life    of    its    own.    I    will    come    and    have    tea    with    you.    That    will    be    just    as    pleasant.” 2417 2416  “Pleasanter    for    you,    I    am    afraid,”    murmured    Hallward    regretfully.    “And    now    good-bye.    I    am    sorry    you    won’t    let 2418 2417  me    look    at    the    picture    once    again.    But    that    can’t    be    helped.    I    quite    understand    what    you    feel    about    it.” 2419 2418  As    he    left    the    room,    Dorian    Gray    smiled    to    himself.    Poor    Basil!    How    little    he    knew    of    the    true    reason!    And    how 2420 2419  strange    it    was    that,    instead    of    having    been    forced    to    reveal    his    own    secret,    he    had    succeeded,    almost    by 2421 2420  chance,    in    wresting    a    secret    from    his    friend!    How    much    that    strange    confession    explained    to    him!    The    painter’s 2422 2421  absurd    ﬁts    of    jealousy,    his    wild    devotion,    his    extravagant    panegyrics,    his    curious    reticences—he    understood 2423 2422  them    all    now,    and    he    felt    sorry.    There    seemed    to    him    to    be    something    tragic    in    a    friendship    so    coloured    by 2424 2423  romance. 2425 2424  He    sighed    and    touched    the    bell.    The    portrait    must    be    hidden    away    at    all    costs.    He    could    not    run    such    a    risk    of 2426 2425  discovery    again.    It    had    been    mad    of    him    to    have    allowed    the    thing    to    remain,    even    for    an    hour,    in    a    room    to 2427 2426  which    any    of    his    friends    had    access. 2428 2427  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                            CHAPTER    X. 2429 2428  When    his    servant    entered,    he    looked    at    him    steadfastly    and    wondered    if    he    had    thought    of    peering    behind    the 2430 2429  screen.    The    man    was    quite    impassive    and    waited    for    his    orders.    Dorian    lit    a    cigarette    and    walked    over    to    the 2431 2430  glass    and    glanced    into    it.    He    could    see    the    reﬂection    of    Victor’s    face    perfectly.    It    was    like    a    placid    mask    of 2432 2431  servility.    There    was    nothing    to    be    afraid    of,    there.    Yet    he    thought    it    best    to    be    on    his    guard. 2433 2432  Speaking    very    slowly,    he    told    him    to    tell    the    house-keeper    that    he    wanted    to    see    her,    and    then    to    go    to    the 2434 2433  frame-maker    and    ask    him    to    send    two    of    his    men    round    at    once.    It    seemed    to    him    that    as    the    man    left    the    room 2435 2434  his    eyes    wandered    in    the    direction    of    the    screen.    Or    was    that    merely    his    own    fancy? 2436 2435  After    a    few    moments,    in    her    black    silk    dress,    with    old-fashioned    thread    mittens    on    her    wrinkled    hands,    Mrs. 2437 2436  Leaf    bustled    into    the    library.    He    asked    her    for    the    key    of    the    schoolroom. 2438 2437  “The    old    schoolroom,    Mr.    Dorian?”    she    exclaimed.    “Why,    it    is    full    of    dust.    I    must    get    it    arranged    and    put 2439 2438  straight    before    you    go    into    it.    It    is    not    fit    for    you    to    see,    sir.    It    is    not,    indeed.” 2440 2439  “I    don’t    want    it    put    straight,    Leaf.    I    only    want    the    key.” 2441 2440  “Well,    sir,    you’ll    be    covered    with    cobwebs    if    you    go    into    it.    Why,    it    hasn’t    been    opened    for    nearly    ﬁve    years— 2442 2441  not    since    his    lordship    died.” 2443 2442  He    winced    at    the    mention    of    his    grandfather.    He    had    hateful    memories    of    him.    “That    does    not    matter,”    he 2444 2443  answered.    “I    simply    want    to    see    the    place—that    is    all.    Give    me    the    key.” 2445 2444  “And    here    is    the    key,    sir,”    said    the    old    lady,    going    over    the    contents    of    her    bunch    with    tremulously    uncertain 2446 2445  hands.    “Here    is    the    key.    I’ll    have    it    oﬀ    the    bunch    in    a    moment.    But    you    don’t    think    of    living    up    there,    sir,    and    you 2447 2446  so    comfortable    here?” 2448 2447  “No,    no,”    he    cried    petulantly.    “Thank    you,    Leaf.    That    will    do.” 2449 2448  She    lingered    for    a    few    moments,    and    was    garrulous    over    some    detail    of    the    household.    He    sighed    and    told 2450 2449  her    to    manage    things    as    she    thought    best.    She    left    the    room,    wreathed    in    smiles. 2451 2450  As    the    door    closed,    Dorian    put    the    key    in    his    pocket    and    looked    round    the    room.    His    eye    fell    on    a    large,    purple 2452 2451  satin    coverlet    heavily    embroidered    with    gold,    a    splendid    piece    of    late    seventeenth-century    Venetian    work    that    his 2453 2452  grandfather    had    found    in    a    convent    near    Bologna.    Yes,    that    would    serve    to    wrap    the    dreadful    thing    in.    It    had 2454 2453  perhaps    served    often    as    a    pall    for    the    dead.    Now    it    was    to    hide    something    that    had    a    corruption    of    its    own,    worse 2455 2454  than    the    corruption    of    death    itself—something    that    would    breed    horrors    and    yet    would    never    die.    What    the    worm 2456 2455  was    to    the    corpse,    his    sins    would    be    to    the    painted    image    on    the    canvas.    They    would    mar    its    beauty    and    eat 2457 2456  away    its    grace.    They    would    deﬁle    it    and    make    it    shameful.    And    yet    the    thing    would    still    live    on.    It    would    be 2458 2457  always    alive. 2459 2458  He    shuddered,    and    for    a    moment    he    regretted    that    he    had    not    told    Basil    the    true    reason    why    he    had    wished    to 2460 2459  hide    the    picture    away.    Basil    would    have    helped    him    to    resist    Lord    Henry’s    inﬂuence,    and    the    still    more 2461 2460  poisonous    inﬂuences    that    came    from    his    own    temperament.    The    love    that    he    bore    him—for    it    was    really    love— 2462 2461  had    nothing    in    it    that    was    not    noble    and    intellectual.    It    was    not    that    mere    physical    admiration    of    beauty    that    is 2463 2462  born    of    the    senses    and    that    dies    when    the    senses    tire.    It    was    such    love    as    Michelangelo    had    known,    and 2464 2463  Montaigne,    and    Winckelmann,    and    Shakespeare    himself.    Yes,    Basil    could    have    saved    him.    But    it    was    too    late 2465 2464  now.    The    past    could    always    be    annihilated.    Regret,    denial,    or    forgetfulness    could    do    that.    But    the    future    was 2466 2465  inevitable.    There    were    passions    in    him    that    would    ﬁnd    their    terrible    outlet,    dreams    that    would    make    the    shadow 2467 2466  of    their    evil    real. 2468 2467  He    took    up    from    the    couch    the    great    purple-and-gold    texture    that    covered    it,    and,    holding    it    in    his    hands, 2469 2468  passed    behind    the    screen.    Was    the    face    on    the    canvas    viler    than    before?    It    seemed    to    him    that    it    was 2470 2469  unchanged,    and    yet    his    loathing    of    it    was    intensiﬁed.    Gold    hair,    blue    eyes,    and    rose-red    lips—they    all    were 2471 2470  there.    It    was    simply    the    expression    that    had    altered.    That    was    horrible    in    its    cruelty.    Compared    to    what    he    saw    in 2472 2471  it    of    censure    or    rebuke,    how    shallow    Basil’s    reproaches    about    Sibyl    Vane    had    been!—how    shallow,    and    of    what 2473 2472  little    account!    His    own    soul    was    looking    out    at    him    from    the    canvas    and    calling    him    to    judgement.    A    look    of    pain 2474 2473  came    across    him,    and    he    ﬂung    the    rich    pall    over    the    picture.    As    he    did    so,    a    knock    came    to    the    door.    He    passed 2475 2474  out    as    his    servant    entered. 2476 2475  “The    persons    are    here,    Monsieur.” 2477 2476  He    felt    that    the    man    must    be    got    rid    of    at    once.    He    must    not    be    allowed    to    know    where    the    picture    was    being 2478 2477  taken    to.    There    was    something    sly    about    him,    and    he    had    thoughtful,    treacherous    eyes.    Sitting    down    at    the 2479 2478  writing-table    he    scribbled    a    note    to    Lord    Henry,    asking    him    to    send    him    round    something    to    read    and    reminding 2480 2479  him    that    they    were    to    meet    at    eight-fifteen    that    evening. 2481 2480  “Wait    for    an    answer,”    he    said,    handing    it    to    him,    “and    show    the    men    in    here.” 2482 2481  In    two    or    three    minutes    there    was    another    knock,    and    Mr.    Hubbard    himself,    the    celebrated    frame-maker    of 2483 2482  South    Audley    Street,    came    in    with    a    somewhat    rough-looking    young    assistant.    Mr.    Hubbard    was    a    ﬂorid,    red- 2484 2483  whiskered    little    man,    whose    admiration    for    art    was    considerably    tempered    by    the    inveterate    impecuniosity    of 2485 2484  most    of    the    artists    who    dealt    with    him.    As    a    rule,    he    never    left    his    shop.    He    waited    for    people    to    come    to    him. 2486 2485  But    he    always    made    an    exception    in    favour    of    Dorian    Gray.    There    was    something    about    Dorian    that    charmed 2487 2486  everybody.    It    was    a    pleasure    even    to    see    him. 2488 2487  “What    can    I    do    for    you,    Mr.    Gray?”    he    said,    rubbing    his    fat    freckled    hands.    “I    thought    I    would    do    myself    the 2489 2488  honour    of    coming    round    in    person.    I    have    just    got    a    beauty    of    a    frame,    sir.    Picked    it    up    at    a    sale.    Old    Florentine. 2490 2489  Came    from    Fonthill,    I    believe.    Admirably    suited    for    a    religious    subject,    Mr.    Gray.” 2491 2490  “I    am    so    sorry    you    have    given    yourself    the    trouble    of    coming    round,    Mr.    Hubbard.    I    shall    certainly    drop    in    and 2492 2491  look    at    the    frame—though    I    don’t    go    in    much    at    present    for    religious    art—but    to-day    I    only    want    a    picture    carried 2493 2492  to    the    top    of    the    house    for    me.    It    is    rather    heavy,    so    I    thought    I    would    ask    you    to    lend    me    a    couple    of    your    men.” 2494 2493  “No    trouble    at    all,    Mr.    Gray.    I    am    delighted    to    be    of    any    service    to    you.    Which    is    the    work    of    art,    sir?” 2495 2494  \\x0c            “This,”    replied    Dorian,    moving    the    screen    back.    “Can    you    move    it,    covering    and    all,    just    as    it    is?    I    don’t    want    i 2496 2495  to    get    scratched    going    upstairs.” 2497 2496  “There    will    be    no    diﬃculty,    sir,”    said    the    genial    frame-maker,    beginning,    with    the    aid    of    his    assistant,    to 2498 2497  unhook    the    picture    from    the    long    brass    chains    by    which    it    was    suspended.    “And,    now,    where    shall    we    carry    it    to, 2499 2498  Mr.    Gray?” 2500 2499  “I    will    show    you    the    way,    Mr.    Hubbard,    if    you    will    kindly    follow    me.    Or    perhaps    you    had    better    go    in    front.    I    am 2501 2500  afraid    it    is    right    at    the    top    of    the    house.    We    will    go    up    by    the    front    staircase,    as    it    is    wider.” 2502 2501  He    held    the    door    open    for    them,    and    they    passed    out    into    the    hall    and    began    the    ascent.    The    elaborate 2503 2502  character    of    the    frame    had    made    the    picture    extremely    bulky,    and    now    and    then,    in    spite    of    the    obsequious 2504 2503  protests    of    Mr.    Hubbard,    who    had    the    true    tradesman’s    spirited    dislike    of    seeing    a    gentleman    doing    anything 2505 2504  useful,    Dorian    put    his    hand    to    it    so    as    to    help    them. 2506 2505  “Something    of    a    load    to    carry,    sir,”    gasped    the    little    man    when    they    reached    the    top    landing.    And    he    wiped    his 2507 2506  shiny    forehead. 2508 2507  “I    am    afraid    it    is    rather    heavy,”    murmured    Dorian    as    he    unlocked    the    door    that    opened    into    the    room    that    was 2509 2508  to    keep    for    him    the    curious    secret    of    his    life    and    hide    his    soul    from    the    eyes    of    men. 2510 2509  He    had    not    entered    the    place    for    more    than    four    years—not,    indeed,    since    he    had    used    it    ﬁrst    as    a    play-room 2511 2510  when    he    was    a    child,    and    then    as    a    study    when    he    grew    somewhat    older.    It    was    a    large,    well-proportioned    room, 2512 2511  which    had    been    specially    built    by    the    last    Lord    Kelso    for    the    use    of    the    little    grandson    whom,    for    his    strange 2513 2512  likeness    to    his    mother,    and    also    for    other    reasons,    he    had    always    hated    and    desired    to    keep    at    a    distance.    It 2514 2513  appeared    to    Dorian    to    have    but    little    changed.    There    was    the    huge    Italian    cassone,    with    its    fantastically    painted 2515 2514  panels    and    its    tarnished    gilt    mouldings,    in    which    he    had    so    often    hidden    himself    as    a    boy.    There    the    satinwood 2516 2515  book-case    ﬁlled    with    his    dog-eared    schoolbooks.    On    the    wall    behind    it    was    hanging    the    same    ragged    Flemish 2517 2516  tapestry    where    a    faded    king    and    queen    were    playing    chess    in    a    garden,    while    a    company    of    hawkers    rode    by, 2518 2517  carrying    hooded    birds    on    their    gauntleted    wrists.    How    well    he    remembered    it    all!    Every    moment    of    his    lonely 2519 2518  childhood    came    back    to    him    as    he    looked    round.    He    recalled    the    stainless    purity    of    his    boyish    life,    and    it    seemed 2520 2519  horrible    to    him    that    it    was    here    the    fatal    portrait    was    to    be    hidden    away.    How    little    he    had    thought,    in    those    dead 2521 2520  days,    of    all    that    was    in    store    for    him! 2522 2521  But    there    was    no    other    place    in    the    house    so    secure    from    prying    eyes    as    this.    He    had    the    key,    and    no    one 2523 2522  else    could    enter    it.    Beneath    its    purple    pall,    the    face    painted    on    the    canvas    could    grow    bestial,    sodden,    and 2524 2523  unclean.    What    did    it    matter?    No    one    could    see    it.    He    himself    would    not    see    it.    Why    should    he    watch    the    hideous 2525 2524  corruption    of    his    soul?    He    kept    his    youth—that    was    enough.    And,    besides,    might    not    his    nature    grow    ﬁner,    after 2526 2525  all?    There    was    no    reason    that    the    future    should    be    so    full    of    shame.    Some    love    might    come    across    his    life,    and 2527 2526  purify    him,    and    shield    him    from    those    sins    that    seemed    to    be    already    stirring    in    spirit    and    in    ﬂesh—those    curious 2528 2527  unpictured    sins    whose    very    mystery    lent    them    their    subtlety    and    their    charm.    Perhaps,    some    day,    the    cruel    look 2529 2528  would    have    passed    away    from    the    scarlet    sensitive    mouth,    and    he    might    show    to    the    world    Basil    Hallward’s 2530 2529  masterpiece. 2531 2530  No;    that    was    impossible.    Hour    by    hour,    and    week    by    week,    the    thing    upon    the    canvas    was    growing    old.    It 2532 2531  might    escape    the    hideousness    of    sin,    but    the    hideousness    of    age    was    in    store    for    it.    The    cheeks    would    become 2533 2532  hollow    or    ﬂaccid.    Yellow    crow’s    feet    would    creep    round    the    fading    eyes    and    make    them    horrible.    The    hair    would 2534 2533  lose    its    brightness,    the    mouth    would    gape    or    droop,    would    be    foolish    or    gross,    as    the    mouths    of    old    men    are. 2535 2534  There    would    be    the    wrinkled    throat,    the    cold,    blue-veined    hands,    the    twisted    body,    that    he    remembered    in    the 2536 2535  grandfather    who    had    been    so    stern    to    him    in    his    boyhood.    The    picture    had    to    be    concealed.    There    was    no    help 2537 2536  for    it. 2538 2537  “Bring    it    in,    Mr.    Hubbard,    please,”    he    said,    wearily,    turning    round.    “I    am    sorry    I    kept    you    so    long.    I    was    thinking 2539 2538  of    something    else.” 2540 2539  “Always    glad    to    have    a    rest,    Mr.    Gray,”    answered    the    frame-maker,    who    was    still    gasping    for    breath.    “Where 2541 2540  shall    we    put    it,    sir?” 2542 2541  “Oh,    anywhere.    Here:    this    will    do.    I    don’t    want    to    have    it    hung    up.    Just    lean    it    against    the    wall.    Thanks.” 2543 2542  “Might    one    look    at    the    work    of    art,    sir?” 2544 2543  Dorian    started.    “It    would    not    interest    you,    Mr.    Hubbard,”    he    said,    keeping    his    eye    on    the    man.    He    felt    ready    to 2545 2544  leap    upon    him    and    ﬂing    him    to    the    ground    if    he    dared    to    lift    the    gorgeous    hanging    that    concealed    the    secret    of 2546 2545  his    life.    “I    shan’t    trouble    you    any    more    now.    I    am    much    obliged    for    your    kindness    in    coming    round.” 2547 2546  “Not    at    all,    not    at    all,    Mr.    Gray.    Ever    ready    to    do    anything    for    you,    sir.”    And    Mr.    Hubbard    tramped    downstairs, 2548 2547  followed    by    the    assistant,    who    glanced    back    at    Dorian    with    a    look    of    shy    wonder    in    his    rough    uncomely    face.    He 2549 2548  had    never    seen    any    one    so    marvellous. 2550 2549  When    the    sound    of    their    footsteps    had    died    away,    Dorian    locked    the    door    and    put    the    key    in    his    pocket.    He 2551 2550  felt    safe    now.    No    one    would    ever    look    upon    the    horrible    thing.    No    eye    but    his    would    ever    see    his    shame. 2552 2551  On    reaching    the    library,    he    found    that    it    was    just    after    ﬁve    o’clock    and    that    the    tea    had    been    already    brought 2553 2552  up.    On    a    little    table    of    dark    perfumed    wood    thickly    incrusted    with    nacre,    a    present    from    Lady    Radley,    his 2554 2553  guardian’s    wife,    a    pretty    professional    invalid,    who    had    spent    the    preceding    winter    in    Cairo,    was    lying    a    note    from 2555 2554  Lord    Henry,    and    beside    it    was    a    book    bound    in    yellow    paper,    the    cover    slightly    torn    and    the    edges    soiled.    A 2556 2555  copy    of    the    third    edition    of    The    St.    James’s    Gazette    had    been    placed    on    the    tea-tray.    It    was    evident    that    Victor 2557 2556  had    returned.    He    wondered    if    he    had    met    the    men    in    the    hall    as    they    were    leaving    the    house    and    had    wormed 2558 2557  out    of    them    what    they    had    been    doing.    He    would    be    sure    to    miss    the    picture—had    no    doubt    missed    it    already, 2559 2558  while    he    had    been    laying    the    tea-things.    The    screen    had    not    been    set    back,    and    a    blank    space    was    visible    on 2560 2559  the    wall.    Perhaps    some    night    he    might    ﬁnd    him    creeping    upstairs    and    trying    to    force    the    door    of    the    room.    It    was 2561 2560  a    horrible    thing    to    have    a    spy    in    one’s    house.    He    had    heard    of    rich    men    who    had    been    blackmailed    all    their    lives 2562 2561  by    some    servant    who    had    read    a    letter,    or    overheard    a    conversation,    or    picked    up    a    card    with    an    address,    or 2563 2562  found    beneath    a    pillow    a    withered    flower    or    a    shred    of    crumpled    lace. 2564 2563  He    sighed,    and    having    poured    himself    out    some    tea,    opened    Lord    Henry’s    note.    It    was    simply    to    say    that    he 2565 2564  \\x0csent    him    round    the    evening    paper,    and    a    book    that    might    interest    him,    and    that    he    would    be    at    the    club    at    eight- 2566 2565  ﬁfteen.    He    opened    The    St.    James’s    languidly,    and    looked    through    it.    A    red    pencil-mark    on    the    ﬁfth    page    caught 2567 2566  his    eye.    It    drew    attention    to    the    following    paragraph: 2568 2567  INQUEST    ON    AN    ACTRESS.—An    inquest    was    held    this    morning    at    the    Bell    Tavern,    Hoxton 2569 2568  Road,    by    Mr.    Danby,    the    District    Coroner,    on    the    body    of    Sibyl    Vane,    a    young    actress 2570 2569  recently    engaged    at    the    Royal    Theatre,    Holborn.    A    verdict    of    death    by    misadventure    was 2571 2570  returned.    Considerable    sympathy    was    expressed    for    the    mother    of    the    deceased,    who 2572 2571  was    greatly    aﬀected    during    the    giving    of    her    own    evidence,    and    that    of    Dr.    Birrell,    who 2573 2572  had    made    the    post-mortem    examination    of    the    deceased. 2574 2573  He    frowned,    and    tearing    the    paper    in    two,    went    across    the    room    and    ﬂung    the    pieces    away.    How    ugly    it    all 2575 2574  was!    And    how    horribly    real    ugliness    made    things!    He    felt    a    little    annoyed    with    Lord    Henry    for    having    sent    him    the 2576 2575  report.    And    it    was    certainly    stupid    of    him    to    have    marked    it    with    red    pencil.    Victor    might    have    read    it.    The    man 2577 2576  knew    more    than    enough    English    for    that. 2578 2577  Perhaps    he    had    read    it    and    had    begun    to    suspect    something.    And,    yet,    what    did    it    matter?    What    had    Dorian 2579 2578  Gray    to    do    with    Sibyl    Vane’s    death?    There    was    nothing    to    fear.    Dorian    Gray    had    not    killed    her. 2580 2579  His    eye    fell    on    the    yellow    book    that    Lord    Henry    had    sent    him.    What    was    it,    he    wondered.    He    went    towards    the 2581 2580  little,    pearl-coloured    octagonal    stand    that    had    always    looked    to    him    like    the    work    of    some    strange    Egyptian    bees 2582 2581  that    wrought    in    silver,    and    taking    up    the    volume,    ﬂung    himself    into    an    arm-chair    and    began    to    turn    over    the 2583 2582  leaves.    After    a    few    minutes    he    became    absorbed.    It    was    the    strangest    book    that    he    had    ever    read.    It    seemed    to 2584 2583  him    that    in    exquisite    raiment,    and    to    the    delicate    sound    of    ﬂutes,    the    sins    of    the    world    were    passing    in    dumb 2585 2584  show    before    him.    Things    that    he    had    dimly    dreamed    of    were    suddenly    made    real    to    him.    Things    of    which    he    had 2586 2585  never    dreamed    were    gradually    revealed. 2587 2586  It    was    a    novel    without    a    plot    and    with    only    one    character,    being,    indeed,    simply    a    psychological    study    of    a 2588 2587  certain    young    Parisian    who    spent    his    life    trying    to    realize    in    the    nineteenth    century    all    the    passions    and    modes 2589 2588  of    thought    that    belonged    to    every    century    except    his    own,    and    to    sum    up,    as    it    were,    in    himself    the    various 2590 2589  moods    through    which    the    world-spirit    had    ever    passed,    loving    for    their    mere    artiﬁciality    those    renunciations    that 2591 2590  men    have    unwisely    called    virtue,    as    much    as    those    natural    rebellions    that    wise    men    still    call    sin.    The    style    in 2592 2591  which    it    was    written    was    that    curious    jewelled    style,    vivid    and    obscure    at    once,    full    of    argot    and    of    archaisms,    of 2593 2592  technical    expressions    and    of    elaborate    paraphrases,    that    characterizes    the    work    of    some    of    the    ﬁnest    artists    of 2594 2593  the    French    school    of    Symbolistes.    There    were    in    it    metaphors    as    monstrous    as    orchids    and    as    subtle    in    colour. 2595 2594  The    life    of    the    senses    was    described    in    the    terms    of    mystical    philosophy.    One    hardly    knew    at    times    whether    one 2596 2595  was    reading    the    spiritual    ecstasies    of    some    mediæval    saint    or    the    morbid    confessions    of    a    modern    sinner.    It 2597 2596  was    a    poisonous    book.    The    heavy    odour    of    incense    seemed    to    cling    about    its    pages    and    to    trouble    the    brain. 2598 2597  The    mere    cadence    of    the    sentences,    the    subtle    monotony    of    their    music,    so    full    as    it    was    of    complex    refrains 2599 2598  and    movements    elaborately    repeated,    produced    in    the    mind    of    the    lad,    as    he    passed    from    chapter    to    chapter,    a 2600 2599  form    of    reverie,    a    malady    of    dreaming,    that    made    him    unconscious    of    the    falling    day    and    creeping    shadows. 2601 2600  Cloudless,    and    pierced    by    one    solitary    star,    a    copper-green    sky    gleamed    through    the    windows.    He    read    on    by 2602 2601  its    wan    light    till    he    could    read    no    more.    Then,    after    his    valet    had    reminded    him    several    times    of    the    lateness    of 2603 2602  the    hour,    he    got    up,    and    going    into    the    next    room,    placed    the    book    on    the    little    Florentine    table    that    always 2604 2603  stood    at    his    bedside    and    began    to    dress    for    dinner. 2605 2604  It    was    almost    nine    o’clock    before    he    reached    the    club,    where    he    found    Lord    Henry    sitting    alone,    in    the 2606 2605  morning-room,    looking    very    much    bored. 2607 2606  “I    am    so    sorry,    Harry,”    he    cried,    “but    really    it    is    entirely    your    fault.    That    book    you    sent    me    so    fascinated    me 2608 2607  that    I    forgot    how    the    time    was    going.” 2609 2608  “Yes,    I    thought    you    would    like    it,”    replied    his    host,    rising    from    his    chair. 2610 2609  “I    didn’t    say    I    liked    it,    Harry.    I    said    it    fascinated    me.    There    is    a    great    difference.” 2611 2610  “Ah,    you    have    discovered    that?”    murmured    Lord    Henry.    And    they    passed    into    the    dining-room. 2612 2611  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                                CHAPTER    XI. 2613 2612  For    years,    Dorian    Gray    could    not    free    himself    from    the    inﬂuence    of    this    book.    Or    perhaps    it    would    be    more 2614 2613  accurate    to    say    that    he    never    sought    to    free    himself    from    it.    He    procured    from    Paris    no    less    than    nine    large- 2615 2614  paper    copies    of    the    ﬁrst    edition,    and    had    them    bound    in    diﬀerent    colours,    so    that    they    might    suit    his    various 2616 2615  moods    and    the    changing    fancies    of    a    nature    over    which    he    seemed,    at    times,    to    have    almost    entirely    lost 2617 2616  control.    The    hero,    the    wonderful    young    Parisian    in    whom    the    romantic    and    the    scientiﬁc    temperaments    were    so 2618 2617  strangely    blended,    became    to    him    a    kind    of    preﬁguring    type    of    himself.    And,    indeed,    the    whole    book    seemed    to 2619 2618  him    to    contain    the    story    of    his    own    life,    written    before    he    had    lived    it. 2620 2619  In    one    point    he    was    more    fortunate    than    the    novel’s    fantastic    hero.    He    never    knew—never,    indeed,    had    any 2621 2620  cause    to    know—that    somewhat    grotesque    dread    of    mirrors,    and    polished    metal    surfaces,    and    still    water    which 2622 2621  came    upon    the    young    Parisian    so    early    in    his    life,    and    was    occasioned    by    the    sudden    decay    of    a    beau    that    had 2623 2622  once,    apparently,    been    so    remarkable.    It    was    with    an    almost    cruel    joy—and    perhaps    in    nearly    every    joy,    as 2624 2623  certainly    in    every    pleasure,    cruelty    has    its    place—that    he    used    to    read    the    latter    part    of    the    book,    with    its    really 2625 2624  tragic,    if    somewhat    overemphasized,    account    of    the    sorrow    and    despair    of    one    who    had    himself    lost    what    in 2626 2625  others,    and    the    world,    he    had    most    dearly    valued. 2627 2626  For    the    wonderful    beauty    that    had    so    fascinated    Basil    Hallward,    and    many    others    besides    him,    seemed    never 2628 2627  to    leave    him.    Even    those    who    had    heard    the    most    evil    things    against    him—and    from    time    to    time    strange 2629 2628  rumours    about    his    mode    of    life    crept    through    London    and    became    the    chatter    of    the    clubs—could    not    believe 2630 2629  anything    to    his    dishonour    when    they    saw    him.    He    had    always    the    look    of    one    who    had    kept    himself    unspotted 2631 2630  from    the    world.    Men    who    talked    grossly    became    silent    when    Dorian    Gray    entered    the    room.    There    was 2632 2631  something    in    the    purity    of    his    face    that    rebuked    them.    His    mere    presence    seemed    to    recall    to    them    the    memory 2633 2632  of    the    innocence    that    they    had    tarnished.    They    wondered    how    one    so    charming    and    graceful    as    he    was    could 2634 2633  have    escaped    the    stain    of    an    age    that    was    at    once    sordid    and    sensual. 2635 2634  Often,    on    returning    home    from    one    of    those    mysterious    and    prolonged    absences    that    gave    rise    to    such 2636 2635  strange    conjecture    among    those    who    were    his    friends,    or    thought    that    they    were    so,    he    himself    would    creep 2637 2636  upstairs    to    the    locked    room,    open    the    door    with    the    key    that    never    left    him    now,    and    stand,    with    a    mirror,    in    front 2638 2637  of    the    portrait    that    Basil    Hallward    had    painted    of    him,    looking    now    at    the    evil    and    aging    face    on    the    canvas,    and 2639 2638  now    at    the    fair    young    face    that    laughed    back    at    him    from    the    polished    glass.    The    very    sharpness    of    the    contrast 2640 2639  used    to    quicken    his    sense    of    pleasure.    He    grew    more    and    more    enamoured    of    his    own    beauty,    more    and    more 2641 2640  interested    in    the    corruption    of    his    own    soul.    He    would    examine    with    minute    care,    and    sometimes    with    a 2642 2641  monstrous    and    terrible    delight,    the    hideous    lines    that    seared    the    wrinkling    forehead    or    crawled    around    the    heavy 2643 2642  sensual    mouth,    wondering    sometimes    which    were    the    more    horrible,    the    signs    of    sin    or    the    signs    of    age.    He 2644 2643  would    place    his    white    hands    beside    the    coarse    bloated    hands    of    the    picture,    and    smile.    He    mocked    the 2645 2644  misshapen    body    and    the    failing    limbs. 2646 2645  There    were    moments,    indeed,    at    night,    when,    lying    sleepless    in    his    own    delicately    scented    chamber,    or    in    the 2647 2646  sordid    room    of    the    little    ill-famed    tavern    near    the    docks    which,    under    an    assumed    name    and    in    disguise,    it    was 2648 2647  his    habit    to    frequent,    he    would    think    of    the    ruin    he    had    brought    upon    his    soul    with    a    pity    that    was    all    the    more 2649 2648  poignant    because    it    was    purely    selﬁsh.    But    moments    such    as    these    were    rare.    That    curiosity    about    life    which 2650 2649  Lord    Henry    had    ﬁrst    stirred    in    him,    as    they    sat    together    in    the    garden    of    their    friend,    seemed    to    increase    with 2651 2650  gratiﬁcation.    The    more    he    knew,    the    more    he    desired    to    know.    He    had    mad    hungers    that    grew    more    ravenous 2652 2651  as    he    fed    them. 2653 2652  Yet    he    was    not    really    reckless,    at    any    rate    in    his    relations    to    society.    Once    or    twice    every    month    during    the 2654 2653  winter,    and    on    each    Wednesday    evening    while    the    season    lasted,    he    would    throw    open    to    the    world    his 2655 2654  beautiful    house    and    have    the    most    celebrated    musicians    of    the    day    to    charm    his    guests    with    the    wonders    of 2656 2655  their    art.    His    little    dinners,    in    the    settling    of    which    Lord    Henry    always    assisted    him,    were    noted    as    much    for    the 2657 2656  careful    selection    and    placing    of    those    invited,    as    for    the    exquisite    taste    shown    in    the    decoration    of    the    table,    with 2658 2657  its    subtle    symphonic    arrangements    of    exotic    ﬂowers,    and    embroidered    cloths,    and    antique    plate    of    gold    and 2659 2658  silver.    Indeed,    there    were    many,    especially    among    the    very    young    men,    who    saw,    or    fancied    that    they    saw,    in 2660 2659  Dorian    Gray    the    true    realization    of    a    type    of    which    they    had    often    dreamed    in    Eton    or    Oxford    days,    a    type    that 2661 2660  was    to    combine    something    of    the    real    culture    of    the    scholar    with    all    the    grace    and    distinction    and    perfect    manner 2662 2661  of    a    citizen    of    the    world.    To    them    he    seemed    to    be    of    the    company    of    those    whom    Dante    describes    as    having 2663 2662  sought    to    “make    themselves    perfect    by    the    worship    of    beauty.”    Like    Gautier,    he    was    one    for    whom    “the    visible 2664 2663  world    existed.” 2665 2664  And,    certainly,    to    him    life    itself    was    the    ﬁrst,    the    greatest,    of    the    arts,    and    for    it    all    the    other    arts    seemed    to    be 2666 2665  but    a    preparation.    Fashion,    by    which    what    is    really    fantastic    becomes    for    a    moment    universal,    and    dandyism, 2667 2666  which,    in    its    own    way,    is    an    attempt    to    assert    the    absolute    modernity    of    beauty,    had,    of    course,    their    fascination 2668 2667  for    him.    His    mode    of    dressing,    and    the    particular    styles    that    from    time    to    time    he    aﬀected,    had    their    marked 2669 2668  inﬂuence    on    the    young    exquisites    of    the    Mayfair    balls    and    Pall    Mall    club    windows,    who    copied    him    in    everything 2670 2669  that    he    did,    and    tried    to    reproduce    the    accidental    charm    of    his    graceful,    though    to    him    only    half-serious, 2671 2670  fopperies. 2672 2671  For,    while    he    was    but    too    ready    to    accept    the    position    that    was    almost    immediately    oﬀered    to    him    on    his 2673 2672  coming    of    age,    and    found,    indeed,    a    subtle    pleasure    in    the    thought    that    he    might    really    become    to    the    London    of 2674 2673  his    own    day    what    to    imperial    Neronian    Rome    the    author    of    the    Satyricon    once    had    been,    yet    in    his    inmost    heart 2675 2674  he    desired    to    be    something    more    than    a    mere    arbiter    elegantiarum,    to    be    consulted    on    the    wearing    of    a    jewel,    or 2676 2675  the    knotting    of    a    necktie,    or    the    conduct    of    a    cane.    He    sought    to    elaborate    some    new    scheme    of    life    that    would 2677 2676  have    its    reasoned    philosophy    and    its    ordered    principles,    and    ﬁnd    in    the    spiritualizing    of    the    senses    its    highest 2678 2677  realization. 2679 2678  The    worship    of    the    senses    has    often,    and    with    much    justice,    been    decried,    men    feeling    a    natural    instinct    of 2680 2679  terror    about    passions    and    sensations    that    seem    stronger    than    themselves,    and    that    they    are    conscious    of 2681 2680  sharing    with    the    less    highly    organized    forms    of    existence.    But    it    appeared    to    Dorian    Gray    that    the    true    nature    of 2682 2681  \\x0cthe    senses    had    never    been    understood,    and    that    they    had    remained    savage    and    animal    merely    because    the 2683 2682  world    had    sought    to    starve    them    into    submission    or    to    kill    them    by    pain,    instead    of    aiming    at    making    them 2684 2683  elements    of    a    new    spirituality,    of    which    a    ﬁne    instinct    for    beauty    was    to    be    the    dominant    characteristic.    As    he 2685 2684  looked    back    upon    man    moving    through    history,    he    was    haunted    by    a    feeling    of    loss.    So    much    had    been 2686 2685  surrendered!    and    to    such    little    purpose!    There    had    been    mad    wilful    rejections,    monstrous    forms    of    self-torture 2687 2686  and    self-denial,    whose    origin    was    fear    and    whose    result    was    a    degradation    inﬁnitely    more    terrible    than    that 2688 2687  fancied    degradation    from    which,    in    their    ignorance,    they    had    sought    to    escape;    Nature,    in    her    wonderful    irony, 2689 2688  driving    out    the    anchorite    to    feed    with    the    wild    animals    of    the    desert    and    giving    to    the    hermit    the    beasts    of    the 2690 2689  field    as    his    companions. 2691 2690  Yes:    there    was    to    be,    as    Lord    Henry    had    prophesied,    a    new    Hedonism    that    was    to    recreate    life    and    to    save    it 2692 2691  from    that    harsh    uncomely    puritanism    that    is    having,    in    our    own    day,    its    curious    revival.    It    was    to    have    its    service 2693 2692  of    the    intellect,    certainly,    yet    it    was    never    to    accept    any    theory    or    system    that    would    involve    the    sacriﬁce    of    any 2694 2693  mode    of    passionate    experience.    Its    aim,    indeed,    was    to    be    experience    itself,    and    not    the    fruits    of    experience, 2695 2694  sweet    or    bitter    as    they    might    be.    Of    the    asceticism    that    deadens    the    senses,    as    of    the    vulgar    proﬂigacy    that 2696 2695  dulls    them,    it    was    to    know    nothing.    But    it    was    to    teach    man    to    concentrate    himself    upon    the    moments    of    a    life 2697 2696  that    is    itself    but    a    moment. 2698 2697  There    are    few    of    us    who    have    not    sometimes    wakened    before    dawn,    either    after    one    of    those    dreamless 2699 2698  nights    that    make    us    almost    enamoured    of    death,    or    one    of    those    nights    of    horror    and    misshapen    joy,    when 2700 2699  through    the    chambers    of    the    brain    sweep    phantoms    more    terrible    than    reality    itself,    and    instinct    with    that    vivid 2701 2700  life    that    lurks    in    all    grotesques,    and    that    lends    to    Gothic    art    its    enduring    vitality,    this    art    being,    one    might    fancy, 2702 2701  especially    the    art    of    those    whose    minds    have    been    troubled    with    the    malady    of    reverie.    Gradually    white    ﬁngers 2703 2702  creep    through    the    curtains,    and    they    appear    to    tremble.    In    black    fantastic    shapes,    dumb    shadows    crawl    into    the 2704 2703  corners    of    the    room    and    crouch    there.    Outside,    there    is    the    stirring    of    birds    among    the    leaves,    or    the    sound    of 2705 2704  men    going    forth    to    their    work,    or    the    sigh    and    sob    of    the    wind    coming    down    from    the    hills    and    wandering    round 2706 2705  the    silent    house,    as    though    it    feared    to    wake    the    sleepers    and    yet    must    needs    call    forth    sleep    from    her    purple 2707 2706  cave.    Veil    after    veil    of    thin    dusky    gauze    is    lifted,    and    by    degrees    the    forms    and    colours    of    things    are    restored    to 2708 2707  them,    and    we    watch    the    dawn    remaking    the    world    in    its    antique    pattern.    The    wan    mirrors    get    back    their    mimic 2709 2708  life.    The    ﬂameless    tapers    stand    where    we    had    left    them,    and    beside    them    lies    the    half-cut    book    that    we    had 2710 2709  been    studying,    or    the    wired    ﬂower    that    we    had    worn    at    the    ball,    or    the    letter    that    we    had    been    afraid    to    read,    or 2711 2710  that    we    had    read    too    often.    Nothing    seems    to    us    changed.    Out    of    the    unreal    shadows    of    the    night    comes    back 2712 2711  the    real    life    that    we    had    known.    We    have    to    resume    it    where    we    had    left    oﬀ,    and    there    steals    over    us    a    terrible 2713 2712  sense    of    the    necessity    for    the    continuance    of    energy    in    the    same    wearisome    round    of    stereotyped    habits,    or    a 2714 2713  wild    longing,    it    may    be,    that    our    eyelids    might    open    some    morning    upon    a    world    that    had    been    refashioned 2715 2714  anew    in    the    darkness    for    our    pleasure,    a    world    in    which    things    would    have    fresh    shapes    and    colours,    and    be 2716 2715  changed,    or    have    other    secrets,    a    world    in    which    the    past    would    have    little    or    no    place,    or    survive,    at    any    rate,    in 2717 2716  no    conscious    form    of    obligation    or    regret,    the    remembrance    even    of    joy    having    its    bitterness    and    the    memories 2718 2717  of    pleasure    their    pain. 2719 2718  It    was    the    creation    of    such    worlds    as    these    that    seemed    to    Dorian    Gray    to    be    the    true    object,    or    amongst    the 2720 2719  true    objects,    of    life;    and    in    his    search    for    sensations    that    would    be    at    once    new    and    delightful,    and    possess    that 2721 2720  element    of    strangeness    that    is    so    essential    to    romance,    he    would    often    adopt    certain    modes    of    thought    that    he 2722 2721  knew    to    be    really    alien    to    his    nature,    abandon    himself    to    their    subtle    inﬂuences,    and    then,    having,    as    it    were, 2723 2722  caught    their    colour    and    satisﬁed    his    intellectual    curiosity,    leave    them    with    that    curious    indiﬀerence    that    is    not 2724 2723  incompatible    with    a    real    ardour    of    temperament,    and    that,    indeed,    according    to    certain    modern    psychologists,    is 2725 2724  often    a    condition    of    it. 2726 2725  It    was    rumoured    of    him    once    that    he    was    about    to    join    the    Roman    Catholic    communion,    and    certainly    the 2727 2726  Roman    ritual    had    always    a    great    attraction    for    him.    The    daily    sacriﬁce,    more    awful    really    than    all    the    sacriﬁces    of 2728 2727  the    antique    world,    stirred    him    as    much    by    its    superb    rejection    of    the    evidence    of    the    senses    as    by    the    primitive 2729 2728  simplicity    of    its    elements    and    the    eternal    pathos    of    the    human    tragedy    that    it    sought    to    symbolize.    He    loved    to 2730 2729  kneel    down    on    the    cold    marble    pavement    and    watch    the    priest,    in    his    stiﬀ    ﬂowered    dalmatic,    slowly    and    with 2731 2730  white    hands    moving    aside    the    veil    of    the    tabernacle,    or    raising    aloft    the    jewelled,    lantern-shaped    monstrance 2732 2731  with    that    pallid    wafer    that    at    times,    one    would    fain    think,    is    indeed    the    “panis    cælestis,”    the    bread    of    angels,    or, 2733 2732  robed    in    the    garments    of    the    Passion    of    Christ,    breaking    the    Host    into    the    chalice    and    smiting    his    breast    for    his 2734 2733  sins.    The    fuming    censers    that    the    grave    boys,    in    their    lace    and    scarlet,    tossed    into    the    air    like    great    gilt    ﬂowers 2735 2734  had    their    subtle    fascination    for    him.    As    he    passed    out,    he    used    to    look    with    wonder    at    the    black    confessionals 2736 2735  and    long    to    sit    in    the    dim    shadow    of    one    of    them    and    listen    to    men    and    women    whispering    through    the    worn 2737 2736  grating    the    true    story    of    their    lives. 2738 2737  But    he    never    fell    into    the    error    of    arresting    his    intellectual    development    by    any    formal    acceptance    of    creed    or 2739 2738  system,    or    of    mistaking,    for    a    house    in    which    to    live,    an    inn    that    is    but    suitable    for    the    sojourn    of    a    night,    or    for 2740 2739  few    hours    of    a    night    in    which    there    are    no    stars    and    the    moon    is    in    travail.    Mysticism,    with    its    marvellous    power 2741 2740  of    making    common    things    strange    to    us,    and    the    subtle    antinomianism    that    always    seems    to    accompany    it, 2742 2741  moved    him    for    a    season;    and    for    a    season    he    inclined    to    the    materialistic    doctrines    of    the    Darwinismus 2743 2742  movement    in    Germany,    and    found    a    curious    pleasure    in    tracing    the    thoughts    and    passions    of    men    to    some 2744 2743  pearly    cell    in    the    brain,    or    some    white    nerve    in    the    body,    delighting    in    the    conception    of    the    absolute 2745 2744  dependence    of    the    spirit    on    certain    physical    conditions,    morbid    or    healthy,    normal    or    diseased.    Yet,    as    has    been 2746 2745  said    of    him    before,    no    theory    of    life    seemed    to    him    to    be    of    any    importance    compared    with    life    itself.    He    felt 2747 2746  keenly    conscious    of    how    barren    all    intellectual    speculation    is    when    separated    from    action    and    experiment.    He 2748 2747  knew    that    the    senses,    no    less    than    the    soul,    have    their    spiritual    mysteries    to    reveal. 2749 2748  And    so    he    would    now    study    perfumes    and    the    secrets    of    their    manufacture,    distilling    heavily    scented    oils    and 2750 2749  burning    odorous    gums    from    the    East.    He    saw    that    there    was    no    mood    of    the    mind    that    had    not    its    counterpart    in 2751 2750  the    sensuous    life,    and    set    himself    to    discover    their    true    relations,    wondering    what    there    was    in    frankincense    that 2752 2751  made    one    mystical,    and    in    ambergris    that    stirred    one’s    passions,    and    in    violets    that    woke    the    memory    of    dead 2753 2752  romances,    and    in    musk    that    troubled    the    brain,    and    in    champak    that    stained    the    imagination;    and    seeking    often 2754 2753  \\x0cto    elaborate    a    real    psychology    of    perfumes,    and    to    estimate    the    several    inﬂuences    of    sweet-smelling    roots    and 2755 2754  scented,    pollen-laden    ﬂowers;    of    aromatic    balms    and    of    dark    and    fragrant    woods;    of    spikenard,    that    sickens;    of 2756 2755  hovenia,    that    makes    men    mad;    and    of    aloes,    that    are    said    to    be    able    to    expel    melancholy    from    the    soul. 2757 2756  At    another    time    he    devoted    himself    entirely    to    music,    and    in    a    long    latticed    room,    with    a    vermilion-and-gold 2758 2757  ceiling    and    walls    of    olive-green    lacquer,    he    used    to    give    curious    concerts    in    which    mad    gipsies    tore    wild    music 2759 2758  from    little    zithers,    or    grave,    yellow-shawled    Tunisians    plucked    at    the    strained    strings    of    monstrous    lutes,    while 2760 2759  grinning    Negroes    beat    monotonously    upon    copper    drums    and,    crouching    upon    scarlet    mats,    slim    turbaned 2761 2760  Indians    blew    through    long    pipes    of    reed    or    brass    and    charmed—or    feigned    to    charm—great    hooded    snakes    and 2762 2761  horrible    horned    adders.    The    harsh    intervals    and    shrill    discords    of    barbaric    music    stirred    him    at    times    when 2763 2762  Schubert’s    grace,    and    Chopin’s    beautiful    sorrows,    and    the    mighty    harmonies    of    Beethoven    himself,    fell 2764 2763  unheeded    on    his    ear.    He    collected    together    from    all    parts    of    the    world    the    strangest    instruments    that    could    be 2765 2764  found,    either    in    the    tombs    of    dead    nations    or    among    the    few    savage    tribes    that    have    survived    contact    with 2766 2765  Western    civilizations,    and    loved    to    touch    and    try    them.    He    had    the    mysterious    juruparis    of    the    Rio    Negro 2767 2766  Indians,    that    women    are    not    allowed    to    look    at    and    that    even    youths    may    not    see    till    they    have    been    subjected 2768 2767  to    fasting    and    scourging,    and    the    earthen    jars    of    the    Peruvians    that    have    the    shrill    cries    of    birds,    and    ﬂutes    of 2769 2768  human    bones    such    as    Alfonso    de    Ovalle    heard    in    Chile,    and    the    sonorous    green    jaspers    that    are    found    near 2770 2769  Cuzco    and    give    forth    a    note    of    singular    sweetness.    He    had    painted    gourds    ﬁlled    with    pebbles    that    rattled    when 2771 2770  they    were    shaken;    the    long    clarin    of    the    Mexicans,    into    which    the    performer    does    not    blow,    but    through    which    he 2772 2771  inhales    the    air;    the    harsh    ture    of    the    Amazon    tribes,    that    is    sounded    by    the    sentinels    who    sit    all    day    long    in    high 2773 2772  trees,    and    can    be    heard,    it    is    said,    at    a    distance    of    three    leagues;    the    teponaztli,    that    has    two    vibrating    tongues 2774 2773  of    wood    and    is    beaten    with    sticks    that    are    smeared    with    an    elastic    gum    obtained    from    the    milky    juice    of    plants; 2775 2774  the    yotl-bells    of    the    Aztecs,    that    are    hung    in    clusters    like    grapes;    and    a    huge    cylindrical    drum,    covered    with    the 2776 2775  skins    of    great    serpents,    like    the    one    that    Bernal    Diaz    saw    when    he    went    with    Cortes    into    the    Mexican    temple, 2777 2776  and    of    whose    doleful    sound    he    has    left    us    so    vivid    a    description.    The    fantastic    character    of    these    instruments 2778 2777  fascinated    him,    and    he    felt    a    curious    delight    in    the    thought    that    art,    like    Nature,    has    her    monsters,    things    of 2779 2778  bestial    shape    and    with    hideous    voices.    Yet,    after    some    time,    he    wearied    of    them,    and    would    sit    in    his    box    at    the 2780 2779  opera,    either    alone    or    with    Lord    Henry,    listening    in    rapt    pleasure    to    “Tannhauser”    and    seeing    in    the    prelude    to 2781 2780  that    great    work    of    art    a    presentation    of    the    tragedy    of    his    own    soul. 2782 2781  On    one    occasion    he    took    up    the    study    of    jewels,    and    appeared    at    a    costume    ball    as    Anne    de    Joyeuse, 2783 2782  Admiral    of    France,    in    a    dress    covered    with    ﬁve    hundred    and    sixty    pearls.    This    taste    enthralled    him    for    years, 2784 2783  and,    indeed,    may    be    said    never    to    have    left    him.    He    would    often    spend    a    whole    day    settling    and    resettling    in 2785 2784  their    cases    the    various    stones    that    he    had    collected,    such    as    the    olive-green    chrysoberyl    that    turns    red    by 2786 2785  lamplight,    the    cymophane    with    its    wirelike    line    of    silver,    the    pistachio-coloured    peridot,    rose-pink    and    wine-yellow 2787 2786  topazes,    carbuncles    of    ﬁery    scarlet    with    tremulous,    four-rayed    stars,    ﬂame-red    cinnamon-stones,    orange    and 2788 2787  violet    spinels,    and    amethysts    with    their    alternate    layers    of    ruby    and    sapphire.    He    loved    the    red    gold    of    the 2789 2788  sunstone,    and    the    moonstone’s    pearly    whiteness,    and    the    broken    rainbow    of    the    milky    opal.    He    procured    from 2790 2789  Amsterdam    three    emeralds    of    extraordinary    size    and    richness    of    colour,    and    had    a    turquoise    de    la    vieille    roche 2791 2790  that    was    the    envy    of    all    the    connoisseurs. 2792 2791  He    discovered    wonderful    stories,    also,    about    jewels.    In    Alphonso’s    Clericalis    Disciplina    a    serpent    was 2793 2792  mentioned    with    eyes    of    real    jacinth,    and    in    the    romantic    history    of    Alexander,    the    Conqueror    of    Emathia    was 2794 2793  said    to    have    found    in    the    vale    of    Jordan    snakes    “with    collars    of    real    emeralds    growing    on    their    backs.”    There 2795 2794  was    a    gem    in    the    brain    of    the    dragon,    Philostratus    told    us,    and    “by    the    exhibition    of    golden    letters    and    a    scarlet 2796 2795  robe”    the    monster    could    be    thrown    into    a    magical    sleep    and    slain.    According    to    the    great    alchemist,    Pierre    de 2797 2796  Boniface,    the    diamond    rendered    a    man    invisible,    and    the    agate    of    India    made    him    eloquent.    The    cornelian 2798 2797  appeased    anger,    and    the    hyacinth    provoked    sleep,    and    the    amethyst    drove    away    the    fumes    of    wine.    The    garnet 2799 2798  cast    out    demons,    and    the    hydropicus    deprived    the    moon    of    her    colour.    The    selenite    waxed    and    waned    with    the 2800 2799  moon,    and    the    meloceus,    that    discovers    thieves,    could    be    aﬀected    only    by    the    blood    of    kids.    Leonardus 2801 2800  Camillus    had    seen    a    white    stone    taken    from    the    brain    of    a    newly    killed    toad,    that    was    a    certain    antidote    against 2802 2801  poison.    The    bezoar,    that    was    found    in    the    heart    of    the    Arabian    deer,    was    a    charm    that    could    cure    the    plague.    In 2803 2802  the    nests    of    Arabian    birds    was    the    aspilates,    that,    according    to    Democritus,    kept    the    wearer    from    any    danger    by 2804 2803  fire. 2805 2804  The    King    of    Ceilan    rode    through    his    city    with    a    large    ruby    in    his    hand,    as    the    ceremony    of    his    coronation.    The 2806 2805  gates    of    the    palace    of    John    the    Priest    were    “made    of    sardius,    with    the    horn    of    the    horned    snake    inwrought,    so 2807 2806  that    no    man    might    bring    poison    within.”    Over    the    gable    were    “two    golden    apples,    in    which    were    two    carbuncles,” 2808 2807  so    that    the    gold    might    shine    by    day    and    the    carbuncles    by    night.    In    Lodge’s    strange    romance    ‘A    Margarite    of 2809 2808  America’,    it    was    stated    that    in    the    chamber    of    the    queen    one    could    behold    “all    the    chaste    ladies    of    the    world, 2810 2809  inchased    out    of    silver,    looking    through    fair    mirrours    of    chrysolites,    carbuncles,    sapphires,    and    greene 2811 2810  emeraults.”    Marco    Polo    had    seen    the    inhabitants    of    Zipangu    place    rose-coloured    pearls    in    the    mouths    of    the 2812 2811  dead.    A    sea-monster    had    been    enamoured    of    the    pearl    that    the    diver    brought    to    King    Perozes,    and    had    slain 2813 2812  the    thief,    and    mourned    for    seven    moons    over    its    loss.    When    the    Huns    lured    the    king    into    the    great    pit,    he    ﬂung    it 2814 2813  away—Procopius    tells    the    story—nor    was    it    ever    found    again,    though    the    Emperor    Anastasius    oﬀered    ﬁve 2815 2814  hundred-weight    of    gold    pieces    for    it.    The    King    of    Malabar    had    shown    to    a    certain    Venetian    a    rosary    of    three 2816 2815  hundred    and    four    pearls,    one    for    every    god    that    he    worshipped. 2817 2816  When    the    Duke    de    Valentinois,    son    of    Alexander    VI.,    visited    Louis    XII.    of    France,    his    horse    was    loaded    with 2818 2817  gold    leaves,    according    to    Brantome,    and    his    cap    had    double    rows    of    rubies    that    threw    out    a    great    light.    Charles 2819 2818  of    England    had    ridden    in    stirrups    hung    with    four    hundred    and    twenty-one    diamonds.    Richard    II    had    a    coat, 2820 2819  valued    at    thirty    thousand    marks,    which    was    covered    with    balas    rubies.    Hall    described    Henry    VIII.,    on    his    way    to 2821 2820  the    Tower    previous    to    his    coronation,    as    wearing    “a    jacket    of    raised    gold,    the    placard    embroidered    with 2822 2821  diamonds    and    other    rich    stones,    and    a    great    bauderike    about    his    neck    of    large    balasses.”    The    favourites    of 2823 2822  James    I    wore    ear-rings    of    emeralds    set    in    gold    ﬁligrane.    Edward    II    gave    to    Piers    Gaveston    a    suit    of    red-gold 2824 2823  armour    studded    with    jacinths,    a    collar    of    gold    roses    set    with    turquoise-stones,    and    a    skull-cap    parsemé    with 2825 2824  pearls.    Henry    II.    wore    jewelled    gloves    reaching    to    the    elbow,    and    had    a    hawk-glove    sewn    with    twelve    rubies    and 2826 2825  \\x0cﬁfty-two    great    orients.    The    ducal    hat    of    Charles    the    Rash,    the    last    Duke    of    Burgundy    of    his    race,    was    hung    with 2827 2826  pear-shaped    pearls    and    studded    with    sapphires. 2828 2827  How    exquisite    life    had    once    been!    How    gorgeous    in    its    pomp    and    decoration!    Even    to    read    of    the    luxury    of    the 2829 2828  dead    was    wonderful. 2830 2829  Then    he    turned    his    attention    to    embroideries    and    to    the    tapestries    that    performed    the    oﬃce    of    frescoes    in    the 2831 2830  chill    rooms    of    the    northern    nations    of    Europe.    As    he    investigated    the    subject—and    he    always    had    an 2832 2831  extraordinary    faculty    of    becoming    absolutely    absorbed    for    the    moment    in    whatever    he    took    up—he    was    almost 2833 2832  saddened    by    the    reﬂection    of    the    ruin    that    time    brought    on    beautiful    and    wonderful    things.    He,    at    any    rate,    had 2834 2833  escaped    that.    Summer    followed    summer,    and    the    yellow    jonquils    bloomed    and    died    many    times,    and    nights    of 2835 2834  horror    repeated    the    story    of    their    shame,    but    he    was    unchanged.    No    winter    marred    his    face    or    stained    his 2836 2835  ﬂowerlike    bloom.    How    diﬀerent    it    was    with    material    things!    Where    had    they    passed    to?    Where    was    the    great 2837 2836  crocus-coloured    robe,    on    which    the    gods    fought    against    the    giants,    that    had    been    worked    by    brown    girls    for    the 2838 2837  pleasure    of    Athena?    Where    the    huge    velarium    that    Nero    had    stretched    across    the    Colosseum    at    Rome,    that 2839 2838  Titan    sail    of    purple    on    which    was    represented    the    starry    sky,    and    Apollo    driving    a    chariot    drawn    by    white,    gilt- 2840 2839  reined    steeds?    He    longed    to    see    the    curious    table-napkins    wrought    for    the    Priest    of    the    Sun,    on    which    were 2841 2840  displayed    all    the    dainties    and    viands    that    could    be    wanted    for    a    feast;    the    mortuary    cloth    of    King    Chilperic,    with 2842 2841  its    three    hundred    golden    bees;    the    fantastic    robes    that    excited    the    indignation    of    the    Bishop    of    Pontus    and    were 2843 2842  ﬁgured    with    “lions,    panthers,    bears,    dogs,    forests,    rocks,    hunters—all,    in    fact,    that    a    painter    can    copy    from 2844 2843  nature”;    and    the    coat    that    Charles    of    Orleans    once    wore,    on    the    sleeves    of    which    were    embroidered    the    verses 2845 2844  of    a    song    beginning    “Madame,    je    suis    tout    joyeux,”    the    musical    accompaniment    of    the    words    being    wrought    in 2846 2845  gold    thread,    and    each    note,    of    square    shape    in    those    days,    formed    with    four    pearls.    He    read    of    the    room    that 2847 2846  was    prepared    at    the    palace    at    Rheims    for    the    use    of    Queen    Joan    of    Burgundy    and    was    decorated    with    “thirteen 2848 2847  hundred    and    twenty-one    parrots,    made    in    broidery,    and    blazoned    with    the    king’s    arms,    and    ﬁve    hundred    and 2849 2848  sixty-one    butterﬂies,    whose    wings    were    similarly    ornamented    with    the    arms    of    the    queen,    the    whole    worked    in 2850 2849  gold.”    Catherine    de    Medicis    had    a    mourning-bed    made    for    her    of    black    velvet    powdered    with    crescents    and 2851 2850  suns.    Its    curtains    were    of    damask,    with    leafy    wreaths    and    garlands,    ﬁgured    upon    a    gold    and    silver    ground,    and 2852 2851  fringed    along    the    edges    with    broideries    of    pearls,    and    it    stood    in    a    room    hung    with    rows    of    the    queen’s    devices 2853 2852  in    cut    black    velvet    upon    cloth    of    silver.    Louis    XIV.    had    gold    embroidered    caryatides    ﬁfteen    feet    high    in    his 2854 2853  apartment.    The    state    bed    of    Sobieski,    King    of    Poland,    was    made    of    Smyrna    gold    brocade    embroidered    in 2855 2854  turquoises    with    verses    from    the    Koran.    Its    supports    were    of    silver    gilt,    beautifully    chased,    and    profusely    set    with 2856 2855  enamelled    and    jewelled    medallions.    It    had    been    taken    from    the    Turkish    camp    before    Vienna,    and    the    standard 2857 2856  of    Mohammed    had    stood    beneath    the    tremulous    gilt    of    its    canopy. 2858 2857  And    so,    for    a    whole    year,    he    sought    to    accumulate    the    most    exquisite    specimens    that    he    could    ﬁnd    of    textile 2859 2858  and    embroidered    work,    getting    the    dainty    Delhi    muslins,    ﬁnely    wrought    with    gold-thread    palmates    and    stitched 2860 2859  over    with    iridescent    beetles’    wings;    the    Dacca    gauzes,    that    from    their    transparency    are    known    in    the    East    as 2861 2860  “woven    air,”    and    “running    water,”    and    “evening    dew”;    strange    ﬁgured    cloths    from    Java;    elaborate    yellow    Chinese 2862 2861  hangings;    books    bound    in    tawny    satins    or    fair    blue    silks    and    wrought    with    fleurs-de-lis,    birds    and    images;    veils    of 2863 2862  lacis    worked    in    Hungary    point;    Sicilian    brocades    and    stiﬀ    Spanish    velvets;    Georgian    work,    with    its    gilt    coins,    and 2864 2863  Japanese    Foukousas,    with    their    green-toned    golds    and    their    marvellously    plumaged    birds. 2865 2864  He    had    a    special    passion,    also,    for    ecclesiastical    vestments,    as    indeed    he    had    for    everything    connected    with 2866 2865  the    service    of    the    Church.    In    the    long    cedar    chests    that    lined    the    west    gallery    of    his    house,    he    had    stored    away 2867 2866  many    rare    and    beautiful    specimens    of    what    is    really    the    raiment    of    the    Bride    of    Christ,    who    must    wear    purple 2868 2867  and    jewels    and    ﬁne    linen    that    she    may    hide    the    pallid    macerated    body    that    is    worn    by    the    suﬀering    that    she 2869 2868  seeks    for    and    wounded    by    self-inﬂicted    pain.    He    possessed    a    gorgeous    cope    of    crimson    silk    and    gold-thread 2870 2869  damask,    ﬁgured    with    a    repeating    pattern    of    golden    pomegranates    set    in    six-petalled    formal    blossoms,    beyond 2871 2870  which    on    either    side    was    the    pine-apple    device    wrought    in    seed-pearls.    The    orphreys    were    divided    into    panels 2872 2871  representing    scenes    from    the    life    of    the    Virgin,    and    the    coronation    of    the    Virgin    was    ﬁgured    in    coloured    silks 2873 2872  upon    the    hood.    This    was    Italian    work    of    the    ﬁfteenth    century.    Another    cope    was    of    green    velvet,    embroidered 2874 2873  with    heart-shaped    groups    of    acanthus-leaves,    from    which    spread    long-stemmed    white    blossoms,    the    details    of 2875 2874  which    were    picked    out    with    silver    thread    and    coloured    crystals.    The    morse    bore    a    seraph’s    head    in    gold-thread 2876 2875  raised    work.    The    orphreys    were    woven    in    a    diaper    of    red    and    gold    silk,    and    were    starred    with    medallions    of 2877 2876  many    saints    and    martyrs,    among    whom    was    St.    Sebastian.    He    had    chasubles,    also,    of    amber-coloured    silk,    and 2878 2877  blue    silk    and    gold    brocade,    and    yellow    silk    damask    and    cloth    of    gold,    ﬁgured    with    representations    of    the    Passion 2879 2878  and    Cruciﬁxion    of    Christ,    and    embroidered    with    lions    and    peacocks    and    other    emblems;    dalmatics    of    white    satin 2880 2879  and    pink    silk    damask,    decorated    with    tulips    and    dolphins    and    fleurs-de-lis;    altar    frontals    of    crimson    velvet    and 2881 2880  blue    linen;    and    many    corporals,    chalice-veils,    and    sudaria.    In    the    mystic    oﬃces    to    which    such    things    were    put, 2882 2881  there    was    something    that    quickened    his    imagination. 2883 2882  For    these    treasures,    and    everything    that    he    collected    in    his    lovely    house,    were    to    be    to    him    means    of 2884 2883  forgetfulness,    modes    by    which    he    could    escape,    for    a    season,    from    the    fear    that    seemed    to    him    at    times    to    be 2885 2884  almost    too    great    to    be    borne.    Upon    the    walls    of    the    lonely    locked    room    where    he    had    spent    so    much    of    his 2886 2885  boyhood,    he    had    hung    with    his    own    hands    the    terrible    portrait    whose    changing    features    showed    him    the    real 2887 2886  degradation    of    his    life,    and    in    front    of    it    had    draped    the    purple-and-gold    pall    as    a    curtain.    For    weeks    he    would    not 2888 2887  go    there,    would    forget    the    hideous    painted    thing,    and    get    back    his    light    heart,    his    wonderful    joyousness,    his 2889 2888  passionate    absorption    in    mere    existence.    Then,    suddenly,    some    night    he    would    creep    out    of    the    house,    go    down 2890 2889  to    dreadful    places    near    Blue    Gate    Fields,    and    stay    there,    day    after    day,    until    he    was    driven    away.    On    his    return 2891 2890  he    would    sit    in    front    of    the    picture,    sometimes    loathing    it    and    himself,    but    ﬁlled,    at    other    times,    with    that    pride    of 2892 2891  individualism    that    is    half    the    fascination    of    sin,    and    smiling    with    secret    pleasure    at    the    misshapen    shadow    that 2893 2892  had    to    bear    the    burden    that    should    have    been    his    own. 2894 2893  After    a    few    years    he    could    not    endure    to    be    long    out    of    England,    and    gave    up    the    villa    that    he    had    shared    at 2895 2894  Trouville    with    Lord    Henry,    as    well    as    the    little    white    walled-in    house    at    Algiers    where    they    had    more    than    once 2896 2895  spent    the    winter.    He    hated    to    be    separated    from    the    picture    that    was    such    a    part    of    his    life,    and    was    also    afraid 2897 2896  that    during    his    absence    some    one    might    gain    access    to    the    room,    in    spite    of    the    elaborate    bars    that    he    had 2898 2897  \\x0ccaused    to    be    placed    upon    the    door. 2899 2898  He    was    quite    conscious    that    this    would    tell    them    nothing.    It    was    true    that    the    portrait    still    preserved,    under    all 2900 2899  the    foulness    and    ugliness    of    the    face,    its    marked    likeness    to    himself;    but    what    could    they    learn    from    that?    He 2901 2900  would    laugh    at    any    one    who    tried    to    taunt    him.    He    had    not    painted    it.    What    was    it    to    him    how    vile    and    full    of 2902 2901  shame    it    looked?    Even    if    he    told    them,    would    they    believe    it? 2903 2902  Yet    he    was    afraid.    Sometimes    when    he    was    down    at    his    great    house    in    Nottinghamshire,    entertaining    the 2904 2903  fashionable    young    men    of    his    own    rank    who    were    his    chief    companions,    and    astounding    the    county    by    the 2905 2904  wanton    luxury    and    gorgeous    splendour    of    his    mode    of    life,    he    would    suddenly    leave    his    guests    and    rush    back    to 2906 2905  town    to    see    that    the    door    had    not    been    tampered    with    and    that    the    picture    was    still    there.    What    if    it    should    be 2907 2906  stolen?    The    mere    thought    made    him    cold    with    horror.    Surely    the    world    would    know    his    secret    then.    Perhaps    the 2908 2907  world    already    suspected    it. 2909 2908  For,    while    he    fascinated    many,    there    were    not    a    few    who    distrusted    him.    He    was    very    nearly    blackballed    at    a 2910 2909  West    End    club    of    which    his    birth    and    social    position    fully    entitled    him    to    become    a    member,    and    it    was    said    that 2911 2910  on    one    occasion,    when    he    was    brought    by    a    friend    into    the    smoking-room    of    the    Churchill,    the    Duke    of    Berwick 2912 2911  and    another    gentleman    got    up    in    a    marked    manner    and    went    out.    Curious    stories    became    current    about    him 2913 2912  after    he    had    passed    his    twenty-ﬁfth    year.    It    was    rumoured    that    he    had    been    seen    brawling    with    foreign    sailors    in 2914 2913  a    low    den    in    the    distant    parts    of    Whitechapel,    and    that    he    consorted    with    thieves    and    coiners    and    knew    the 2915 2914  mysteries    of    their    trade.    His    extraordinary    absences    became    notorious,    and,    when    he    used    to    reappear    again    in 2916 2915  society,    men    would    whisper    to    each    other    in    corners,    or    pass    him    with    a    sneer,    or    look    at    him    with    cold 2917 2916  searching    eyes,    as    though    they    were    determined    to    discover    his    secret. 2918 2917  Of    such    insolences    and    attempted    slights    he,    of    course,    took    no    notice,    and    in    the    opinion    of    most    people    his 2919 2918  frank    debonair    manner,    his    charming    boyish    smile,    and    the    inﬁnite    grace    of    that    wonderful    youth    that    seemed 2920 2919  never    to    leave    him,    were    in    themselves    a    suﬃcient    answer    to    the    calumnies,    for    so    they    termed    them,    that    were 2921 2920  circulated    about    him.    It    was    remarked,    however,    that    some    of    those    who    had    been    most    intimate    with    him 2922 2921  appeared,    after    a    time,    to    shun    him.    Women    who    had    wildly    adored    him,    and    for    his    sake    had    braved    all    social 2923 2922  censure    and    set    convention    at    deﬁance,    were    seen    to    grow    pallid    with    shame    or    horror    if    Dorian    Gray    entered 2924 2923  the    room. 2925 2924  Yet    these    whispered    scandals    only    increased    in    the    eyes    of    many    his    strange    and    dangerous    charm.    His 2926 2925  great    wealth    was    a    certain    element    of    security.    Society—civilized    society,    at    least—is    never    very    ready    to 2927 2926  believe    anything    to    the    detriment    of    those    who    are    both    rich    and    fascinating.    It    feels    instinctively    that    manners 2928 2927  are    of    more    importance    than    morals,    and,    in    its    opinion,    the    highest    respectability    is    of    much    less    value    than    the 2929 2928  possession    of    a    good    chef.    And,    after    all,    it    is    a    very    poor    consolation    to    be    told    that    the    man    who    has    given    one 2930 2929  a    bad    dinner,    or    poor    wine,    is    irreproachable    in    his    private    life.    Even    the    cardinal    virtues    cannot    atone    for    half- 2931 2930  cold    entrées,    as    Lord    Henry    remarked    once,    in    a    discussion    on    the    subject,    and    there    is    possibly    a    good    deal    to 2932 2931  be    said    for    his    view.    For    the    canons    of    good    society    are,    or    should    be,    the    same    as    the    canons    of    art.    Form    is 2933 2932  absolutely    essential    to    it.    It    should    have    the    dignity    of    a    ceremony,    as    well    as    its    unreality,    and    should    combine 2934 2933  the    insincere    character    of    a    romantic    play    with    the    wit    and    beauty    that    make    such    plays    delightful    to    us.    Is 2935 2934  insincerity    such    a    terrible    thing?    I    think    not.    It    is    merely    a    method    by    which    we    can    multiply    our    personalities. 2936 2935  Such,    at    any    rate,    was    Dorian    Gray’s    opinion.    He    used    to    wonder    at    the    shallow    psychology    of    those    who 2937 2936  conceive    the    ego    in    man    as    a    thing    simple,    permanent,    reliable,    and    of    one    essence.    To    him,    man    was    a    being 2938 2937  with    myriad    lives    and    myriad    sensations,    a    complex    multiform    creature    that    bore    within    itself    strange    legacies    of 2939 2938  thought    and    passion,    and    whose    very    ﬂesh    was    tainted    with    the    monstrous    maladies    of    the    dead.    He    loved    to 2940 2939  stroll    through    the    gaunt    cold    picture-gallery    of    his    country    house    and    look    at    the    various    portraits    of    those    whose 2941 2940  blood    ﬂowed    in    his    veins.    Here    was    Philip    Herbert,    described    by    Francis    Osborne,    in    his    Memoires    on    the 2942 2941  Reigns    of    Queen    Elizabeth    and    King    James,    as    one    who    was    “caressed    by    the    Court    for    his    handsome    face, 2943 2942  which    kept    him    not    long    company.”    Was    it    young    Herbert’s    life    that    he    sometimes    led?    Had    some    strange 2944 2943  poisonous    germ    crept    from    body    to    body    till    it    had    reached    his    own?    Was    it    some    dim    sense    of    that    ruined    grace 2945 2944  that    had    made    him    so    suddenly,    and    almost    without    cause,    give    utterance,    in    Basil    Hallward’s    studio,    to    the    mad 2946 2945  prayer    that    had    so    changed    his    life?    Here,    in    gold-embroidered    red    doublet,    jewelled    surcoat,    and    gilt-edged    ruﬀ 2947 2946  and    wristbands,    stood    Sir    Anthony    Sherard,    with    his    silver-and-black    armour    piled    at    his    feet.    What    had    this 2948 2947  man’s    legacy    been?    Had    the    lover    of    Giovanna    of    Naples    bequeathed    him    some    inheritance    of    sin    and    shame? 2949 2948  Were    his    own    actions    merely    the    dreams    that    the    dead    man    had    not    dared    to    realize?    Here,    from    the    fading 2950 2949  canvas,    smiled    Lady    Elizabeth    Devereux,    in    her    gauze    hood,    pearl    stomacher,    and    pink    slashed    sleeves.    A 2951 2950  ﬂower    was    in    her    right    hand,    and    her    left    clasped    an    enamelled    collar    of    white    and    damask    roses.    On    a    table    by 2952 2951  her    side    lay    a    mandolin    and    an    apple.    There    were    large    green    rosettes    upon    her    little    pointed    shoes.    He    knew 2953 2952  her    life,    and    the    strange    stories    that    were    told    about    her    lovers.    Had    he    something    of    her    temperament    in    him? 2954 2953  These    oval,    heavy-lidded    eyes    seemed    to    look    curiously    at    him.    What    of    George    Willoughby,    with    his    powdered 2955 2954  hair    and    fantastic    patches?    How    evil    he    looked!    The    face    was    saturnine    and    swarthy,    and    the    sensual    lips 2956 2955  seemed    to    be    twisted    with    disdain.    Delicate    lace    ruﬄes    fell    over    the    lean    yellow    hands    that    were    so    overladen 2957 2956  with    rings.    He    had    been    a    macaroni    of    the    eighteenth    century,    and    the    friend,    in    his    youth,    of    Lord    Ferrars.    What 2958 2957  of    the    second    Lord    Beckenham,    the    companion    of    the    Prince    Regent    in    his    wildest    days,    and    one    of    the 2959 2958  witnesses    at    the    secret    marriage    with    Mrs.    Fitzherbert?    How    proud    and    handsome    he    was,    with    his    chestnut 2960 2959  curls    and    insolent    pose!    What    passions    had    he    bequeathed?    The    world    had    looked    upon    him    as    infamous.    He 2961 2960  had    led    the    orgies    at    Carlton    House.    The    star    of    the    Garter    glittered    upon    his    breast.    Beside    him    hung    the 2962 2961  portrait    of    his    wife,    a    pallid,    thin-lipped    woman    in    black.    Her    blood,    also,    stirred    within    him.    How    curious    it    all 2963 2962  seemed!    And    his    mother    with    her    Lady    Hamilton    face    and    her    moist,    wine-dashed    lips—he    knew    what    he    had 2964 2963  got    from    her.    He    had    got    from    her    his    beauty,    and    his    passion    for    the    beauty    of    others.    She    laughed    at    him    in 2965 2964  her    loose    Bacchante    dress.    There    were    vine    leaves    in    her    hair.    The    purple    spilled    from    the    cup    she    was    holding. 2966 2965  The    carnations    of    the    painting    had    withered,    but    the    eyes    were    still    wonderful    in    their    depth    and    brilliancy    of 2967 2966  colour.    They    seemed    to    follow    him    wherever    he    went. 2968 2967  Yet    one    had    ancestors    in    literature    as    well    as    in    one’s    own    race,    nearer    perhaps    in    type    and    temperament, 2969 2968  many    of    them,    and    certainly    with    an    inﬂuence    of    which    one    was    more    absolutely    conscious.    There    were    times 2970 2969  \\x0cwhen    it    appeared    to    Dorian    Gray    that    the    whole    of    history    was    merely    the    record    of    his    own    life,    not    as    he    had 2971 2970  lived    it    in    act    and    circumstance,    but    as    his    imagination    had    created    it    for    him,    as    it    had    been    in    his    brain    and    in 2972 2971  his    passions.    He    felt    that    he    had    known    them    all,    those    strange    terrible    ﬁgures    that    had    passed    across    the    stage 2973 2972  of    the    world    and    made    sin    so    marvellous    and    evil    so    full    of    subtlety.    It    seemed    to    him    that    in    some    mysterious 2974 2973  way    their    lives    had    been    his    own. 2975 2974  The    hero    of    the    wonderful    novel    that    had    so    inﬂuenced    his    life    had    himself    known    this    curious    fancy.    In    the 2976 2975  seventh    chapter    he    tells    how,    crowned    with    laurel,    lest    lightning    might    strike    him,    he    had    sat,    as    Tiberius,    in    a 2977 2976  garden    at    Capri,    reading    the    shameful    books    of    Elephantis,    while    dwarfs    and    peacocks    strutted    round    him    and 2978 2977  the    ﬂute-player    mocked    the    swinger    of    the    censer;    and,    as    Caligula,    had    caroused    with    the    green-shirted 2979 2978  jockeys    in    their    stables    and    supped    in    an    ivory    manger    with    a    jewel-frontleted    horse;    and,    as    Domitian,    had 2980 2979  wandered    through    a    corridor    lined    with    marble    mirrors,    looking    round    with    haggard    eyes    for    the    reﬂection    of    the 2981 2980  dagger    that    was    to    end    his    days,    and    sick    with    that    ennui,    that    terrible    tædium    vitæ,    that    comes    on    those    to 2982 2981  whom    life    denies    nothing;    and    had    peered    through    a    clear    emerald    at    the    red    shambles    of    the    circus    and    then, 2983 2982  in    a    litter    of    pearl    and    purple    drawn    by    silver-shod    mules,    been    carried    through    the    Street    of    Pomegranates    to    a 2984 2983  House    of    Gold    and    heard    men    cry    on    Nero    Caesar    as    he    passed    by;    and,    as    Elagabalus,    had    painted    his    face 2985 2984  with    colours,    and    plied    the    distaﬀ    among    the    women,    and    brought    the    Moon    from    Carthage    and    given    her    in 2986 2985  mystic    marriage    to    the    Sun. 2987 2986  Over    and    over    again    Dorian    used    to    read    this    fantastic    chapter,    and    the    two    chapters    immediately    following,    in 2988 2987  which,    as    in    some    curious    tapestries    or    cunningly    wrought    enamels,    were    pictured    the    awful    and    beautiful    forms 2989 2988  of    those    whom    vice    and    blood    and    weariness    had    made    monstrous    or    mad:    Filippo,    Duke    of    Milan,    who    slew    his 2990 2989  wife    and    painted    her    lips    with    a    scarlet    poison    that    her    lover    might    suck    death    from    the    dead    thing    he    fondled; 2991 2990  Pietro    Barbi,    the    Venetian,    known    as    Paul    the    Second,    who    sought    in    his    vanity    to    assume    the    title    of    Formosus, 2992 2991  and    whose    tiara,    valued    at    two    hundred    thousand    ﬂorins,    was    bought    at    the    price    of    a    terrible    sin;    Gian    Maria 2993 2992  Visconti,    who    used    hounds    to    chase    living    men    and    whose    murdered    body    was    covered    with    roses    by    a    harlot 2994 2993  who    had    loved    him;    the    Borgia    on    his    white    horse,    with    Fratricide    riding    beside    him    and    his    mantle    stained    with 2995 2994  the    blood    of    Perotto;    Pietro    Riario,    the    young    Cardinal    Archbishop    of    Florence,    child    and    minion    of    Sixtus    IV., 2996 2995  whose    beauty    was    equalled    only    by    his    debauchery,    and    who    received    Leonora    of    Aragon    in    a    pavilion    of    white 2997 2996  and    crimson    silk,    ﬁlled    with    nymphs    and    centaurs,    and    gilded    a    boy    that    he    might    serve    at    the    feast    as 2998 2997  Ganymede    or    Hylas;    Ezzelin,    whose    melancholy    could    be    cured    only    by    the    spectacle    of    death,    and    who    had    a 2999 2998  passion    for    red    blood,    as    other    men    have    for    red    wine—the    son    of    the    Fiend,    as    was    reported,    and    one    who    had 3000 2999  cheated    his    father    at    dice    when    gambling    with    him    for    his    own    soul;    Giambattista    Cibo,    who    in    mockery    took    the 3001 3000  name    of    Innocent    and    into    whose    torpid    veins    the    blood    of    three    lads    was    infused    by    a    Jewish    doctor; 3002 3001  Sigismondo    Malatesta,    the    lover    of    Isotta    and    the    lord    of    Rimini,    whose    eﬃgy    was    burned    at    Rome    as    the 3003 3002  enemy    of    God    and    man,    who    strangled    Polyssena    with    a    napkin,    and    gave    poison    to    Ginevra    d’Este    in    a    cup    of 3004 3003  emerald,    and    in    honour    of    a    shameful    passion    built    a    pagan    church    for    Christian    worship;    Charles    VI.,    who    had 3005 3004  so    wildly    adored    his    brother’s    wife    that    a    leper    had    warned    him    of    the    insanity    that    was    coming    on    him,    and    who, 3006 3005  when    his    brain    had    sickened    and    grown    strange,    could    only    be    soothed    by    Saracen    cards    painted    with    the 3007 3006  images    of    love    and    death    and    madness;    and,    in    his    trimmed    jerkin    and    jewelled    cap    and    acanthuslike    curls, 3008 3007  Grifonetto    Baglioni,    who    slew    Astorre    with    his    bride,    and    Simonetto    with    his    page,    and    whose    comeliness    was 3009 3008  such    that,    as    he    lay    dying    in    the    yellow    piazza    of    Perugia,    those    who    had    hated    him    could    not    choose    but    weep, 3010 3009  and    Atalanta,    who    had    cursed    him,    blessed    him. 3011 3010  There    was    a    horrible    fascination    in    them    all.    He    saw    them    at    night,    and    they    troubled    his    imagination    in    the 3012 3011  day.    The    Renaissance    knew    of    strange    manners    of    poisoning—poisoning    by    a    helmet    and    a    lighted    torch,    by    an 3013 3012  embroidered    glove    and    a    jewelled    fan,    by    a    gilded    pomander    and    by    an    amber    chain.    Dorian    Gray    had    been 3014 3013  poisoned    by    a    book.    There    were    moments    when    he    looked    on    evil    simply    as    a    mode    through    which    he    could 3015 3014  realize    his    conception    of    the    beautiful. 3016 3015  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                                CHAPTER    XII. 3017 3016  It    was    on    the    ninth    of    November,    the    eve    of    his    own    thirty-eighth    birthday,    as    he    often    remembered 3018 3017  afterwards. 3019 3018  He    was    walking    home    about    eleven    o’clock    from    Lord    Henry’s,    where    he    had    been    dining,    and    was    wrapped 3020 3019  in    heavy    furs,    as    the    night    was    cold    and    foggy.    At    the    corner    of    Grosvenor    Square    and    South    Audley    Street,    a 3021 3020  man    passed    him    in    the    mist,    walking    very    fast    and    with    the    collar    of    his    grey    ulster    turned    up.    He    had    a    bag    in 3022 3021  his    hand.    Dorian    recognized    him.    It    was    Basil    Hallward.    A    strange    sense    of    fear,    for    which    he    could    not    account, 3023 3022  came    over    him.    He    made    no    sign    of    recognition    and    went    on    quickly    in    the    direction    of    his    own    house. 3024 3023  But    Hallward    had    seen    him.    Dorian    heard    him    ﬁrst    stopping    on    the    pavement    and    then    hurrying    after    him.    In    a 3025 3024  few    moments,    his    hand    was    on    his    arm. 3026 3025  “Dorian!    What    an    extraordinary    piece    of    luck!    I    have    been    waiting    for    you    in    your    library    ever    since    nine 3027 3026  o’clock.    Finally    I    took    pity    on    your    tired    servant    and    told    him    to    go    to    bed,    as    he    let    me    out.    I    am    oﬀ    to    Paris    by 3028 3027  the    midnight    train,    and    I    particularly    wanted    to    see    you    before    I    left.    I    thought    it    was    you,    or    rather    your    fur    coat, 3029 3028  as    you    passed    me.    But    I    wasn’t    quite    sure.    Didn’t    you    recognize    me?” 3030 3029  “In    this    fog,    my    dear    Basil?    Why,    I    can’t    even    recognize    Grosvenor    Square.    I    believe    my    house    is    somewhere 3031 3030  about    here,    but    I    don’t    feel    at    all    certain    about    it.    I    am    sorry    you    are    going    away,    as    I    have    not    seen    you    for    ages 3032 3031  But    I    suppose    you    will    be    back    soon?” 3033 3032  “No:    I    am    going    to    be    out    of    England    for    six    months.    I    intend    to    take    a    studio    in    Paris    and    shut    myself    up    till    I 3034 3033  have    ﬁnished    a    great    picture    I    have    in    my    head.    However,    it    wasn’t    about    myself    I    wanted    to    talk.    Here    we    are    at 3035 3034  your    door.    Let    me    come    in    for    a    moment.    I    have    something    to    say    to    you.” 3036 3035  “I    shall    be    charmed.    But    won’t    you    miss    your    train?”    said    Dorian    Gray    languidly    as    he    passed    up    the    steps 3037 3036  and    opened    the    door    with    his    latch-key. 3038 3037  The    lamplight    struggled    out    through    the    fog,    and    Hallward    looked    at    his    watch.    “I    have    heaps    of    time,”    he 3039 3038  answered.    “The    train    doesn’t    go    till    twelve-ﬁfteen,    and    it    is    only    just    eleven.    In    fact,    I    was    on    my    way    to    the    club 3040 3039  to    look    for    you,    when    I    met    you.    You    see,    I    shan’t    have    any    delay    about    luggage,    as    I    have    sent    on    my    heavy 3041 3040  things.    All    I    have    with    me    is    in    this    bag,    and    I    can    easily    get    to    Victoria    in    twenty    minutes.” 3042 3041  Dorian    looked    at    him    and    smiled.    “What    a    way    for    a    fashionable    painter    to    travel!    A    Gladstone    bag    and    an 3043 3042  ulster!    Come    in,    or    the    fog    will    get    into    the    house.    And    mind    you    don’t    talk    about    anything    serious.    Nothing    is 3044 3043  serious    nowadays.    At    least    nothing    should    be.” 3045 3044  Hallward    shook    his    head,    as    he    entered,    and    followed    Dorian    into    the    library.    There    was    a    bright    wood    ﬁre 3046 3045  blazing    in    the    large    open    hearth.    The    lamps    were    lit,    and    an    open    Dutch    silver    spirit-case    stood,    with    some 3047 3046  siphons    of    soda-water    and    large    cut-glass    tumblers,    on    a    little    marqueterie    table. 3048 3047  “You    see    your    servant    made    me    quite    at    home,    Dorian.    He    gave    me    everything    I    wanted,    including    your    best 3049 3048  gold-tipped    cigarettes.    He    is    a    most    hospitable    creature.    I    like    him    much    better    than    the    Frenchman    you    used    to 3050 3049  have.    What    has    become    of    the    Frenchman,    by    the    bye?” 3051 3050  Dorian    shrugged    his    shoulders.    “I    believe    he    married    Lady    Radley’s    maid,    and    has    established    her    in    Paris    as 3052 3051  an    English    dressmaker.    Anglomanie    is    very    fashionable    over    there    now,    I    hear.    It    seems    silly    of    the    French, 3053 3052  doesn’t    it?    But—do    you    know?—he    was    not    at    all    a    bad    servant.    I    never    liked    him,    but    I    had    nothing    to    complain 3054 3053  about.    One    often    imagines    things    that    are    quite    absurd.    He    was    really    very    devoted    to    me    and    seemed    quite 3055 3054  sorry    when    he    went    away.    Have    another    brandy-and-soda?    Or    would    you    like    hock-and-seltzer?    I    always    take 3056 3055  hock-and-seltzer    myself.    There    is    sure    to    be    some    in    the    next    room.” 3057 3056  “Thanks,    I    won’t    have    anything    more,”    said    the    painter,    taking    his    cap    and    coat    oﬀ    and    throwing    them    on    the 3058 3057  bag    that    he    had    placed    in    the    corner.    “And    now,    my    dear    fellow,    I    want    to    speak    to    you    seriously.    Don’t    frown 3059 3058  like    that.    You    make    it    so    much    more    difficult    for    me.” 3060 3059  “What    is    it    all    about?”    cried    Dorian    in    his    petulant    way,    ﬂinging    himself    down    on    the    sofa.    “I    hope    it    is    not    about 3061 3060  myself.    I    am    tired    of    myself    to-night.    I    should    like    to    be    somebody    else.” 3062 3061  “It    is    about    yourself,”    answered    Hallward    in    his    grave    deep    voice,    “and    I    must    say    it    to    you.    I    shall    only    keep 3063 3062  you    half    an    hour.” 3064 3063  Dorian    sighed    and    lit    a    cigarette.    “Half    an    hour!”    he    murmured. 3065 3064  “It    is    not    much    to    ask    of    you,    Dorian,    and    it    is    entirely    for    your    own    sake    that    I    am    speaking.    I    think    it    right    tha 3066 3065  you    should    know    that    the    most    dreadful    things    are    being    said    against    you    in    London.” 3067 3066  “I    don’t    wish    to    know    anything    about    them.    I    love    scandals    about    other    people,    but    scandals    about    myself 3068 3067  don’t    interest    me.    They    have    not    got    the    charm    of    novelty.” 3069 3068  “They    must    interest    you,    Dorian.    Every    gentleman    is    interested    in    his    good    name.    You    don’t    want    people    to 3070 3069  talk    of    you    as    something    vile    and    degraded.    Of    course,    you    have    your    position,    and    your    wealth,    and    all    that    kind 3071 3070  of    thing.    But    position    and    wealth    are    not    everything.    Mind    you,    I    don’t    believe    these    rumours    at    all.    At    least,    I 3072 3071  can’t    believe    them    when    I    see    you.    Sin    is    a    thing    that    writes    itself    across    a    man’s    face.    It    cannot    be    concealed. 3073 3072  People    talk    sometimes    of    secret    vices.    There    are    no    such    things.    If    a    wretched    man    has    a    vice,    it    shows    itself    in 3074 3073  the    lines    of    his    mouth,    the    droop    of    his    eyelids,    the    moulding    of    his    hands    even.    Somebody—I    won’t    mention    his 3075 3074  name,    but    you    know    him—came    to    me    last    year    to    have    his    portrait    done.    I    had    never    seen    him    before,    and    had 3076 3075  never    heard    anything    about    him    at    the    time,    though    I    have    heard    a    good    deal    since.    He    oﬀered    an    extravagant 3077 3076  price.    I    refused    him.    There    was    something    in    the    shape    of    his    ﬁngers    that    I    hated.    I    know    now    that    I    was    quite 3078 3077  right    in    what    I    fancied    about    him.    His    life    is    dreadful.    But    you,    Dorian,    with    your    pure,    bright,    innocent    face,    and 3079 3078  your    marvellous    untroubled    youth—I    can’t    believe    anything    against    you.    And    yet    I    see    you    very    seldom,    and    you 3080 3079  never    come    down    to    the    studio    now,    and    when    I    am    away    from    you,    and    I    hear    all    these    hideous    things    that 3081 3080  people    are    whispering    about    you,    I    don’t    know    what    to    say.    Why    is    it,    Dorian,    that    a    man    like    the    Duke    of 3082 3081  Berwick    leaves    the    room    of    a    club    when    you    enter    it?    Why    is    it    that    so    many    gentlemen    in    London    will    neither    go 3083 3082  \\x0cto    your    house    or    invite    you    to    theirs?    You    used    to    be    a    friend    of    Lord    Staveley.    I    met    him    at    dinner    last    week. 3084 3083  Your    name    happened    to    come    up    in    conversation,    in    connection    with    the    miniatures    you    have    lent    to    the 3085 3084  exhibition    at    the    Dudley.    Staveley    curled    his    lip    and    said    that    you    might    have    the    most    artistic    tastes,    but    that 3086 3085  you    were    a    man    whom    no    pure-minded    girl    should    be    allowed    to    know,    and    whom    no    chaste    woman    should    sit 3087 3086  in    the    same    room    with.    I    reminded    him    that    I    was    a    friend    of    yours,    and    asked    him    what    he    meant.    He    told    me. 3088 3087  He    told    me    right    out    before    everybody.    It    was    horrible!    Why    is    your    friendship    so    fatal    to    young    men?    There    was 3089 3088  that    wretched    boy    in    the    Guards    who    committed    suicide.    You    were    his    great    friend.    There    was    Sir    Henry 3090 3089  Ashton,    who    had    to    leave    England    with    a    tarnished    name.    You    and    he    were    inseparable.    What    about    Adrian 3091 3090  Singleton    and    his    dreadful    end?    What    about    Lord    Kent’s    only    son    and    his    career?    I    met    his    father    yesterday    in 3092 3091  St.    James’s    Street.    He    seemed    broken    with    shame    and    sorrow.    What    about    the    young    Duke    of    Perth?    What    sort 3093 3092  of    life    has    he    got    now?    What    gentleman    would    associate    with    him?” 3094 3093  “Stop,    Basil.    You    are    talking    about    things    of    which    you    know    nothing,”    said    Dorian    Gray,    biting    his    lip,    and 3095 3094  with    a    note    of    inﬁnite    contempt    in    his    voice.    “You    ask    me    why    Berwick    leaves    a    room    when    I    enter    it.    It    is 3096 3095  because    I    know    everything    about    his    life,    not    because    he    knows    anything    about    mine.    With    such    blood    as    he 3097 3096  has    in    his    veins,    how    could    his    record    be    clean?    You    ask    me    about    Henry    Ashton    and    young    Perth.    Did    I    teach 3098 3097  the    one    his    vices,    and    the    other    his    debauchery?    If    Kent’s    silly    son    takes    his    wife    from    the    streets,    what    is    that    to 3099 3098  me?    If    Adrian    Singleton    writes    his    friend’s    name    across    a    bill,    am    I    his    keeper?    I    know    how    people    chatter    in 3100 3099  England.    The    middle    classes    air    their    moral    prejudices    over    their    gross    dinner-tables,    and    whisper    about    what 3101 3100  they    call    the    proﬂigacies    of    their    betters    in    order    to    try    and    pretend    that    they    are    in    smart    society    and    on    intimate 3102 3101  terms    with    the    people    they    slander.    In    this    country,    it    is    enough    for    a    man    to    have    distinction    and    brains    for    every 3103 3102  common    tongue    to    wag    against    him.    And    what    sort    of    lives    do    these    people,    who    pose    as    being    moral,    lead 3104 3103  themselves?    My    dear    fellow,    you    forget    that    we    are    in    the    native    land    of    the    hypocrite.” 3105 3104  “Dorian,”    cried    Hallward,    “that    is    not    the    question.    England    is    bad    enough    I    know,    and    English    society    is    all 3106 3105  wrong.    That    is    the    reason    why    I    want    you    to    be    ﬁne.    You    have    not    been    ﬁne.    One    has    a    right    to    judge    of    a    man 3107 3106  by    the    eﬀect    he    has    over    his    friends.    Yours    seem    to    lose    all    sense    of    honour,    of    goodness,    of    purity.    You    have 3108 3107  filled    them    with    a    madness    for    pleasure.    They    have    gone    down    into    the    depths.    You    led    them    there.    Yes:    you    led 3109 3108  them    there,    and    yet    you    can    smile,    as    you    are    smiling    now.    And    there    is    worse    behind.    I    know    you    and    Harry    are 3110 3109  inseparable.    Surely    for    that    reason,    if    for    none    other,    you    should    not    have    made    his    sister’s    name    a    by-word.” 3111 3110  “Take    care,    Basil.    You    go    too    far.” 3112 3111  “I    must    speak,    and    you    must    listen.    You    shall    listen.    When    you    met    Lady    Gwendolen,    not    a    breath    of    scandal 3113 3112  had    ever    touched    her.    Is    there    a    single    decent    woman    in    London    now    who    would    drive    with    her    in    the    park? 3114 3113  Why,    even    her    children    are    not    allowed    to    live    with    her.    Then    there    are    other    stories—stories    that    you    have 3115 3114  been    seen    creeping    at    dawn    out    of    dreadful    houses    and    slinking    in    disguise    into    the    foulest    dens    in    London.    Are 3116 3115  they    true?    Can    they    be    true?    When    I    ﬁrst    heard    them,    I    laughed.    I    hear    them    now,    and    they    make    me    shudder. 3117 3116  What    about    your    country-house    and    the    life    that    is    led    there?    Dorian,    you    don’t    know    what    is    said    about    you.    I 3118 3117  won’t    tell    you    that    I    don’t    want    to    preach    to    you.    I    remember    Harry    saying    once    that    every    man    who    turned 3119 3118  himself    into    an    amateur    curate    for    the    moment    always    began    by    saying    that,    and    then    proceeded    to    break    his 3120 3119  word.    I    do    want    to    preach    to    you.    I    want    you    to    lead    such    a    life    as    will    make    the    world    respect    you.    I    want    you    to 3121 3120  have    a    clean    name    and    a    fair    record.    I    want    you    to    get    rid    of    the    dreadful    people    you    associate    with.    Don’t    shrug 3122 3121  your    shoulders    like    that.    Don’t    be    so    indiﬀerent.    You    have    a    wonderful    inﬂuence.    Let    it    be    for    good,    not    for    evil. 3123 3122  They    say    that    you    corrupt    every    one    with    whom    you    become    intimate,    and    that    it    is    quite    suﬃcient    for    you    to 3124 3123  enter    a    house    for    shame    of    some    kind    to    follow    after.    I    don’t    know    whether    it    is    so    or    not.    How    should    I    know? 3125 3124  But    it    is    said    of    you.    I    am    told    things    that    it    seems    impossible    to    doubt.    Lord    Gloucester    was    one    of    my    greatest 3126 3125  friends    at    Oxford.    He    showed    me    a    letter    that    his    wife    had    written    to    him    when    she    was    dying    alone    in    her    villa 3127 3126  at    Mentone.    Your    name    was    implicated    in    the    most    terrible    confession    I    ever    read.    I    told    him    that    it    was    absurd— 3128 3127  that    I    knew    you    thoroughly,    and    that    you    were    incapable    of    anything    of    the    kind.    Know    you?    I    wonder    do    I    know 3129 3128  you?    Before    I    could    answer    that,    I    should    have    to    see    your    soul.” 3130 3129  “To    see    my    soul!”    muttered    Dorian    Gray,    starting    up    from    the    sofa    and    turning    almost    white    from    fear. 3131 3130  “Yes,”    answered    Hallward    gravely,    and    with    deep-toned    sorrow    in    his    voice,    “to    see    your    soul.    But    only    God 3132 3131  can    do    that.” 3133 3132  A    bitter    laugh    of    mockery    broke    from    the    lips    of    the    younger    man.    “You    shall    see    it    yourself,    to-night!”    he    cried, 3134 3133  seizing    a    lamp    from    the    table.    “Come:    it    is    your    own    handiwork.    Why    shouldn’t    you    look    at    it?    You    can    tell    the 3135 3134  world    all    about    it    afterwards,    if    you    choose.    Nobody    would    believe    you.    If    they    did    believe    you,    they    would    like 3136 3135  me    all    the    better    for    it.    I    know    the    age    better    than    you    do,    though    you    will    prate    about    it    so    tediously.    Come,    I    tel 3137 3136  you.    You    have    chattered    enough    about    corruption.    Now    you    shall    look    on    it    face    to    face.” 3138 3137  There    was    the    madness    of    pride    in    every    word    he    uttered.    He    stamped    his    foot    upon    the    ground    in    his    boyish 3139 3138  insolent    manner.    He    felt    a    terrible    joy    at    the    thought    that    some    one    else    was    to    share    his    secret,    and    that    the 3140 3139  man    who    had    painted    the    portrait    that    was    the    origin    of    all    his    shame    was    to    be    burdened    for    the    rest    of    his    life 3141 3140  with    the    hideous    memory    of    what    he    had    done. 3142 3141  “Yes,”    he    continued,    coming    closer    to    him    and    looking    steadfastly    into    his    stern    eyes,    “I    shall    show    you    my 3143 3142  soul.    You    shall    see    the    thing    that    you    fancy    only    God    can    see.” 3144 3143  Hallward    started    back.    “This    is    blasphemy,    Dorian!”    he    cried.    “You    must    not    say    things    like    that.    They    are 3145 3144  horrible,    and    they    don’t    mean    anything.” 3146 3145  “You    think    so?”    He    laughed    again. 3147 3146  “I    know    so.    As    for    what    I    said    to    you    to-night,    I    said    it    for    your    good.    You    know    I    have    been    always    a    stanch 3148 3147  friend    to    you.” 3149 3148  “Don’t    touch    me.    Finish    what    you    have    to    say.” 3150 3149  A    twisted    ﬂash    of    pain    shot    across    the    painter’s    face.    He    paused    for    a    moment,    and    a    wild    feeling    of    pity 3151 3150  came    over    him.    After    all,    what    right    had    he    to    pry    into    the    life    of    Dorian    Gray?    If    he    had    done    a    tithe    of    what    was 3152 3151  rumoured    about    him,    how    much    he    must    have    suﬀered!    Then    he    straightened    himself    up,    and    walked    over    to 3153 3152  the    ﬁre-place,    and    stood    there,    looking    at    the    burning    logs    with    their    frostlike    ashes    and    their    throbbing    cores    of 3154 3153  \\x0cflame. 3155 3154  “I    am    waiting,    Basil,”    said    the    young    man    in    a    hard    clear    voice. 3156 3155  He    turned    round.    “What    I    have    to    say    is    this,”    he    cried.    “You    must    give    me    some    answer    to    these    horrible 3157 3156  charges    that    are    made    against    you.    If    you    tell    me    that    they    are    absolutely    untrue    from    beginning    to    end,    I    shall 3158 3157  believe    you.    Deny    them,    Dorian,    deny    them!    Can’t    you    see    what    I    am    going    through?    My    God!    don’t    tell    me    that 3159 3158  you    are    bad,    and    corrupt,    and    shameful.” 3160 3159  Dorian    Gray    smiled.    There    was    a    curl    of    contempt    in    his    lips.    “Come    upstairs,    Basil,”    he    said    quietly.    “I    keep    a 3161 3160  diary    of    my    life    from    day    to    day,    and    it    never    leaves    the    room    in    which    it    is    written.    I    shall    show    it    to    you    if    yo 3162 3161  come    with    me.” 3163 3162  “I    shall    come    with    you,    Dorian,    if    you    wish    it.    I    see    I    have    missed    my    train.    That    makes    no    matter.    I    can    go    to- 3164 3163  morrow.    But    don’t    ask    me    to    read    anything    to-night.    All    I    want    is    a    plain    answer    to    my    question.” 3165 3164  “That    shall    be    given    to    you    upstairs.    I    could    not    give    it    here.    You    will    not    have    to    read    long.” 3166 3165  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                        CHAPTER    XIII. 3167 3166  He    passed    out    of    the    room    and    began    the    ascent,    Basil    Hallward    following    close    behind.    They    walked    softly, 3168 3167  as    men    do    instinctively    at    night.    The    lamp    cast    fantastic    shadows    on    the    wall    and    staircase.    A    rising    wind    made 3169 3168  some    of    the    windows    rattle. 3170 3169  When    they    reached    the    top    landing,    Dorian    set    the    lamp    down    on    the    ﬂoor,    and    taking    out    the    key,    turned    it    in 3171 3170  the    lock.    “You    insist    on    knowing,    Basil?”    he    asked    in    a    low    voice. 3172 3171  “Yes.” 3173 3172  “I    am    delighted,”    he    answered,    smiling.    Then    he    added,    somewhat    harshly,    “You    are    the    one    man    in    the    world 3174 3173  who    is    entitled    to    know    everything    about    me.    You    have    had    more    to    do    with    my    life    than    you    think”;    and,    taking 3175 3174  up    the    lamp,    he    opened    the    door    and    went    in.    A    cold    current    of    air    passed    them,    and    the    light    shot    up    for    a 3176 3175  moment    in    a    ﬂame    of    murky    orange.    He    shuddered.    “Shut    the    door    behind    you,”    he    whispered,    as    he    placed    the 3177 3176  lamp    on    the    table. 3178 3177  Hallward    glanced    round    him    with    a    puzzled    expression.    The    room    looked    as    if    it    had    not    been    lived    in    for 3179 3178  years.    A    faded    Flemish    tapestry,    a    curtained    picture,    an    old    Italian    cassone,    and    an    almost    empty    book-case— 3180 3179  that    was    all    that    it    seemed    to    contain,    besides    a    chair    and    a    table.    As    Dorian    Gray    was    lighting    a    half-burned 3181 3180  candle    that    was    standing    on    the    mantelshelf,    he    saw    that    the    whole    place    was    covered    with    dust    and    that    the 3182 3181  carpet    was    in    holes.    A    mouse    ran    scuffling    behind    the    wainscoting.    There    was    a    damp    odour    of    mildew. 3183 3182  “So    you    think    that    it    is    only    God    who    sees    the    soul,    Basil?    Draw    that    curtain    back,    and    you    will    see    mine.” 3184 3183  The    voice    that    spoke    was    cold    and    cruel.    “You    are    mad,    Dorian,    or    playing    a    part,”    muttered    Hallward, 3185 3184  frowning. 3186 3185  “You    won’t?    Then    I    must    do    it    myself,”    said    the    young    man,    and    he    tore    the    curtain    from    its    rod    and    ﬂung    it    on 3187 3186  the    ground. 3188 3187  An    exclamation    of    horror    broke    from    the    painter’s    lips    as    he    saw    in    the    dim    light    the    hideous    face    on    the 3189 3188  canvas    grinning    at    him.    There    was    something    in    its    expression    that    ﬁlled    him    with    disgust    and    loathing.    Good 3190 3189  heavens!    it    was    Dorian    Gray’s    own    face    that    he    was    looking    at!    The    horror,    whatever    it    was,    had    not    yet    entirely 3191 3190  spoiled    that    marvellous    beauty.    There    was    still    some    gold    in    the    thinning    hair    and    some    scarlet    on    the    sensual 3192 3191  mouth.    The    sodden    eyes    had    kept    something    of    the    loveliness    of    their    blue,    the    noble    curves    had    not    yet 3193 3192  completely    passed    away    from    chiselled    nostrils    and    from    plastic    throat.    Yes,    it    was    Dorian    himself.    But    who    had 3194 3193  done    it?    He    seemed    to    recognize    his    own    brushwork,    and    the    frame    was    his    own    design.    The    idea    was 3195 3194  monstrous,    yet    he    felt    afraid.    He    seized    the    lighted    candle,    and    held    it    to    the    picture.    In    the    left-hand    corner    was 3196 3195  his    own    name,    traced    in    long    letters    of    bright    vermilion. 3197 3196  It    was    some    foul    parody,    some    infamous    ignoble    satire.    He    had    never    done    that.    Still,    it    was    his    own    picture. 3198 3197  He    knew    it,    and    he    felt    as    if    his    blood    had    changed    in    a    moment    from    ﬁre    to    sluggish    ice.    His    own    picture!    What 3199 3198  did    it    mean?    Why    had    it    altered?    He    turned    and    looked    at    Dorian    Gray    with    the    eyes    of    a    sick    man.    His    mouth 3200 3199  twitched,    and    his    parched    tongue    seemed    unable    to    articulate.    He    passed    his    hand    across    his    forehead.    It    was 3201 3200  dank    with    clammy    sweat. 3202 3201  The    young    man    was    leaning    against    the    mantelshelf,    watching    him    with    that    strange    expression    that    one    sees 3203 3202  on    the    faces    of    those    who    are    absorbed    in    a    play    when    some    great    artist    is    acting.    There    was    neither    real 3204 3203  sorrow    in    it    nor    real    joy.    There    was    simply    the    passion    of    the    spectator,    with    perhaps    a    ﬂicker    of    triumph    in    his 3205 3204  eyes.    He    had    taken    the    flower    out    of    his    coat,    and    was    smelling    it,    or    pretending    to    do    so. 3206 3205  “What    does    this    mean?”    cried    Hallward,    at    last.    His    own    voice    sounded    shrill    and    curious    in    his    ears. 3207 3206  “Years    ago,    when    I    was    a    boy,”    said    Dorian    Gray,    crushing    the    ﬂower    in    his    hand,    “you    met    me,    ﬂattered    me, 3208 3207  and    taught    me    to    be    vain    of    my    good    looks.    One    day    you    introduced    me    to    a    friend    of    yours,    who    explained    to 3209 3208  me    the    wonder    of    youth,    and    you    ﬁnished    a    portrait    of    me    that    revealed    to    me    the    wonder    of    beauty.    In    a    mad 3210 3209  moment    that,    even    now,    I    don’t    know    whether    I    regret    or    not,    I    made    a    wish,    perhaps    you    would    call    it    a 3211 3210  prayer....” 3212 3211  “I    remember    it!    Oh,    how    well    I    remember    it!    No!    the    thing    is    impossible.    The    room    is    damp.    Mildew    has    got    into 3213 3212  the    canvas.    The    paints    I    used    had    some    wretched    mineral    poison    in    them.    I    tell    you    the    thing    is    impossible.” 3214 3213  “Ah,    what    is    impossible?”    murmured    the    young    man,    going    over    to    the    window    and    leaning    his    forehead 3215 3214  against    the    cold,    mist-stained    glass. 3216 3215  “You    told    me    you    had    destroyed    it.” 3217 3216  “I    was    wrong.    It    has    destroyed    me.” 3218 3217  “I    don’t    believe    it    is    my    picture.” 3219 3218  “Can’t    you    see    your    ideal    in    it?”    said    Dorian    bitterly. 3220 3219  “My    ideal,    as    you    call    it...” 3221 3220  “As    you    called    it.” 3222 3221  “There    was    nothing    evil    in    it,    nothing    shameful.    You    were    to    me    such    an    ideal    as    I    shall    never    meet    again. 3223 3222  This    is    the    face    of    a    satyr.” 3224 3223  “It    is    the    face    of    my    soul.” 3225 3224  “Christ!    what    a    thing    I    must    have    worshipped!    It    has    the    eyes    of    a    devil.” 3226 3225  “Each    of    us    has    heaven    and    hell    in    him,    Basil,”    cried    Dorian    with    a    wild    gesture    of    despair. 3227 3226  Hallward    turned    again    to    the    portrait    and    gazed    at    it.    “My    God!    If    it    is    true,”    he    exclaimed,    “and    this    is    what    you 3228 3227  have    done    with    your    life,    why,    you    must    be    worse    even    than    those    who    talk    against    you    fancy    you    to    be!”    He 3229 3228  held    the    light    up    again    to    the    canvas    and    examined    it.    The    surface    seemed    to    be    quite    undisturbed    and    as    he 3230 3229  had    left    it.    It    was    from    within,    apparently,    that    the    foulness    and    horror    had    come.    Through    some    strange 3231 3230  quickening    of    inner    life    the    leprosies    of    sin    were    slowly    eating    the    thing    away.    The    rotting    of    a    corpse    in    a    watery 3232 3231  \\x0cgrave    was    not    so    fearful. 3233 3232  His    hand    shook,    and    the    candle    fell    from    its    socket    on    the    ﬂoor    and    lay    there    sputtering.    He    placed    his    foot    on 3234 3233  it    and    put    it    out.    Then    he    ﬂung    himself    into    the    rickety    chair    that    was    standing    by    the    table    and    buried    his    face    in 3235 3234  his    hands. 3236 3235  “Good    God,    Dorian,    what    a    lesson!    What    an    awful    lesson!”    There    was    no    answer,    but    he    could    hear    the    young 3237 3236  man    sobbing    at    the    window.    “Pray,    Dorian,    pray,”    he    murmured.    “What    is    it    that    one    was    taught    to    say    in    one’s 3238 3237  boyhood?    ‘Lead    us    not    into    temptation.    Forgive    us    our    sins.    Wash    away    our    iniquities.’    Let    us    say    that    together. 3239 3238  The    prayer    of    your    pride    has    been    answered.    The    prayer    of    your    repentance    will    be    answered    also.    I 3240 3239  worshipped    you    too    much.    I    am    punished    for    it.    You    worshipped    yourself    too    much.    We    are    both    punished.” 3241 3240  Dorian    Gray    turned    slowly    around    and    looked    at    him    with    tear-dimmed    eyes.    “It    is    too    late,    Basil,”    he    faltered. 3242 3241  “It    is    never    too    late,    Dorian.    Let    us    kneel    down    and    try    if    we    cannot    remember    a    prayer.    Isn’t    there    a    verse 3243 3242  somewhere,    ‘Though    your    sins    be    as    scarlet,    yet    I    will    make    them    as    white    as    snow’?” 3244 3243  “Those    words    mean    nothing    to    me    now.” 3245 3244  “Hush!    Don’t    say    that.    You    have    done    enough    evil    in    your    life.    My    God!    Don’t    you    see    that    accursed    thing 3246 3245  leering    at    us?” 3247 3246  Dorian    Gray    glanced    at    the    picture,    and    suddenly    an    uncontrollable    feeling    of    hatred    for    Basil    Hallward    came 3248 3247  over    him,    as    though    it    had    been    suggested    to    him    by    the    image    on    the    canvas,    whispered    into    his    ear    by    those 3249 3248  grinning    lips.    The    mad    passions    of    a    hunted    animal    stirred    within    him,    and    he    loathed    the    man    who    was    seated 3250 3249  at    the    table,    more    than    in    his    whole    life    he    had    ever    loathed    anything.    He    glanced    wildly    around.    Something 3251 3250  glimmered    on    the    top    of    the    painted    chest    that    faced    him.    His    eye    fell    on    it.    He    knew    what    it    was.    It    was    a    knife 3252 3251  that    he    had    brought    up,    some    days    before,    to    cut    a    piece    of    cord,    and    had    forgotten    to    take    away    with    him.    He 3253 3252  moved    slowly    towards    it,    passing    Hallward    as    he    did    so.    As    soon    as    he    got    behind    him,    he    seized    it    and    turned 3254 3253  round.    Hallward    stirred    in    his    chair    as    if    he    was    going    to    rise.    He    rushed    at    him    and    dug    the    knife    into    the    great 3255 3254  vein    that    is    behind    the    ear,    crushing    the    man’s    head    down    on    the    table    and    stabbing    again    and    again. 3256 3255  There    was    a    stiﬂed    groan    and    the    horrible    sound    of    some    one    choking    with    blood.    Three    times    the 3257 3256  outstretched    arms    shot    up    convulsively,    waving    grotesque,    stiﬀ-ﬁngered    hands    in    the    air.    He    stabbed    him    twice 3258 3257  more,    but    the    man    did    not    move.    Something    began    to    trickle    on    the    ﬂoor.    He    waited    for    a    moment,    still    pressing 3259 3258  the    head    down.    Then    he    threw    the    knife    on    the    table,    and    listened. 3260 3259  He    could    hear    nothing,    but    the    drip,    drip    on    the    threadbare    carpet.    He    opened    the    door    and    went    out    on    the 3261 3260  landing.    The    house    was    absolutely    quiet.    No    one    was    about.    For    a    few    seconds    he    stood    bending    over    the 3262 3261  balustrade    and    peering    down    into    the    black    seething    well    of    darkness.    Then    he    took    out    the    key    and    returned    to 3263 3262  the    room,    locking    himself    in    as    he    did    so. 3264 3263  The    thing    was    still    seated    in    the    chair,    straining    over    the    table    with    bowed    head,    and    humped    back,    and    long 3265 3264  fantastic    arms.    Had    it    not    been    for    the    red    jagged    tear    in    the    neck    and    the    clotted    black    pool    that    was    slowly 3266 3265  widening    on    the    table,    one    would    have    said    that    the    man    was    simply    asleep. 3267 3266  How    quickly    it    had    all    been    done!    He    felt    strangely    calm,    and    walking    over    to    the    window,    opened    it    and 3268 3267  stepped    out    on    the    balcony.    The    wind    had    blown    the    fog    away,    and    the    sky    was    like    a    monstrous    peacock’s    tail, 3269 3268  starred    with    myriads    of    golden    eyes.    He    looked    down    and    saw    the    policeman    going    his    rounds    and    ﬂashing    the 3270 3269  long    beam    of    his    lantern    on    the    doors    of    the    silent    houses.    The    crimson    spot    of    a    prowling    hansom    gleamed    at 3271 3270  the    corner    and    then    vanished.    A    woman    in    a    ﬂuttering    shawl    was    creeping    slowly    by    the    railings,    staggering    as 3272 3271  she    went.    Now    and    then    she    stopped    and    peered    back.    Once,    she    began    to    sing    in    a    hoarse    voice.    The 3273 3272  policeman    strolled    over    and    said    something    to    her.    She    stumbled    away,    laughing.    A    bitter    blast    swept    across    the 3274 3273  square.    The    gas-lamps    ﬂickered    and    became    blue,    and    the    leaﬂess    trees    shook    their    black    iron    branches    to    and 3275 3274  fro.    He    shivered    and    went    back,    closing    the    window    behind    him. 3276 3275  Having    reached    the    door,    he    turned    the    key    and    opened    it.    He    did    not    even    glance    at    the    murdered    man.    He 3277 3276  felt    that    the    secret    of    the    whole    thing    was    not    to    realize    the    situation.    The    friend    who    had    painted    the    fatal 3278 3277  portrait    to    which    all    his    misery    had    been    due    had    gone    out    of    his    life.    That    was    enough. 3279 3278  Then    he    remembered    the    lamp.    It    was    a    rather    curious    one    of    Moorish    workmanship,    made    of    dull    silver    inlaid 3280 3279  with    arabesques    of    burnished    steel,    and    studded    with    coarse    turquoises.    Perhaps    it    might    be    missed    by    his 3281 3280  servant,    and    questions    would    be    asked.    He    hesitated    for    a    moment,    then    he    turned    back    and    took    it    from    the 3282 3281  table.    He    could    not    help    seeing    the    dead    thing.    How    still    it    was!    How    horribly    white    the    long    hands    looked!    It    was 3283 3282  like    a    dreadful    wax    image. 3284 3283  Having    locked    the    door    behind    him,    he    crept    quietly    downstairs.    The    woodwork    creaked    and    seemed    to    cry 3285 3284  out    as    if    in    pain.    He    stopped    several    times    and    waited.    No:    everything    was    still.    It    was    merely    the    sound    of    his 3286 3285  own    footsteps. 3287 3286  When    he    reached    the    library,    he    saw    the    bag    and    coat    in    the    corner.    They    must    be    hidden    away    somewhere. 3288 3287  He    unlocked    a    secret    press    that    was    in    the    wainscoting,    a    press    in    which    he    kept    his    own    curious    disguises,    and 3289 3288  put    them    into    it.    He    could    easily    burn    them    afterwards.    Then    he    pulled    out    his    watch.    It    was    twenty    minutes    to 3290 3289  two. 3291 3290  He    sat    down    and    began    to    think.    Every    year—every    month,    almost—men    were    strangled    in    England    for    what 3292 3291  he    had    done.    There    had    been    a    madness    of    murder    in    the    air.    Some    red    star    had    come    too    close    to    the    earth.... 3293 3292  And    yet,    what    evidence    was    there    against    him?    Basil    Hallward    had    left    the    house    at    eleven.    No    one    had    seen 3294 3293  him    come    in    again.    Most    of    the    servants    were    at    Selby    Royal.    His    valet    had    gone    to    bed....    Paris!    Yes.    It    was    to 3295 3294  Paris    that    Basil    had    gone,    and    by    the    midnight    train,    as    he    had    intended.    With    his    curious    reserved    habits,    it 3296 3295  would    be    months    before    any    suspicions    would    be    roused.    Months!    Everything    could    be    destroyed    long    before 3297 3296  then. 3298 3297  A    sudden    thought    struck    him.    He    put    on    his    fur    coat    and    hat    and    went    out    into    the    hall.    There    he    paused, 3299 3298  hearing    the    slow    heavy    tread    of    the    policeman    on    the    pavement    outside    and    seeing    the    ﬂash    of    the    bull’s-eye 3300 3299  reflected    in    the    window.    He    waited    and    held    his    breath. 3301 3300  After    a    few    moments    he    drew    back    the    latch    and    slipped    out,    shutting    the    door    very    gently    behind    him.    Then 3302 3301  \\x0che    began    ringing    the    bell.    In    about    five    minutes    his    valet    appeared,    half-dressed    and    looking    very    drowsy. 3303 3302  “I    am    sorry    to    have    had    to    wake    you    up,    Francis,”    he    said,    stepping    in;    “but    I    had    forgotten    my    latch-key.    What 3304 3303  time    is    it?” 3305 3304  “Ten    minutes    past    two,    sir,”    answered    the    man,    looking    at    the    clock    and    blinking. 3306 3305  “Ten    minutes    past    two?    How    horribly    late!    You    must    wake    me    at    nine    to-morrow.    I    have    some    work    to    do.” 3307 3306  “All    right,    sir.” 3308 3307  “Did    any    one    call    this    evening?” 3309 3308  “Mr.    Hallward,    sir.    He    stayed    here    till    eleven,    and    then    he    went    away    to    catch    his    train.” 3310 3309  “Oh!    I    am    sorry    I    didn’t    see    him.    Did    he    leave    any    message?” 3311 3310  “No,    sir,    except    that    he    would    write    to    you    from    Paris,    if    he    did    not    find    you    at    the    club.” 3312 3311  “That    will    do,    Francis.    Don’t    forget    to    call    me    at    nine    to-morrow.” 3313 3312  “No,    sir.” 3314 3313  The    man    shambled    down    the    passage    in    his    slippers. 3315 3314  Dorian    Gray    threw    his    hat    and    coat    upon    the    table    and    passed    into    the    library.    For    a    quarter    of    an    hour    he 3316 3315  walked    up    and    down    the    room,    biting    his    lip    and    thinking.    Then    he    took    down    the    Blue    Book    from    one    of    the 3317 3316  shelves    and    began    to    turn    over    the    leaves.    “Alan    Campbell,    152,    Hertford    Street,    Mayfair.”    Yes;    that    was    the 3318 3317  man    he    wanted. 3319 3318  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                                    CHAPTER    XIV. 3320 3319  At    nine    o’clock    the    next    morning    his    servant    came    in    with    a    cup    of    chocolate    on    a    tray    and    opened    the 3321 3320  shutters.    Dorian    was    sleeping    quite    peacefully,    lying    on    his    right    side,    with    one    hand    underneath    his    cheek.    He 3322 3321  looked    like    a    boy    who    had    been    tired    out    with    play,    or    study. 3323 3322  The    man    had    to    touch    him    twice    on    the    shoulder    before    he    woke,    and    as    he    opened    his    eyes    a    faint    smile 3324 3323  passed    across    his    lips,    as    though    he    had    been    lost    in    some    delightful    dream.    Yet    he    had    not    dreamed    at    all.    His 3325 3324  night    had    been    untroubled    by    any    images    of    pleasure    or    of    pain.    But    youth    smiles    without    any    reason.    It    is    one 3326 3325  of    its    chiefest    charms. 3327 3326  He    turned    round,    and    leaning    upon    his    elbow,    began    to    sip    his    chocolate.    The    mellow    November    sun    came 3328 3327  streaming    into    the    room.    The    sky    was    bright,    and    there    was    a    genial    warmth    in    the    air.    It    was    almost    like    a 3329 3328  morning    in    May. 3330 3329  Gradually    the    events    of    the    preceding    night    crept    with    silent,    blood-stained    feet    into    his    brain    and 3331 3330  reconstructed    themselves    there    with    terrible    distinctness.    He    winced    at    the    memory    of    all    that    he    had    suﬀered, 3332 3331  and    for    a    moment    the    same    curious    feeling    of    loathing    for    Basil    Hallward    that    had    made    him    kill    him    as    he    sat    in 3333 3332  the    chair    came    back    to    him,    and    he    grew    cold    with    passion.    The    dead    man    was    still    sitting    there,    too,    and    in    the 3334 3333  sunlight    now.    How    horrible    that    was!    Such    hideous    things    were    for    the    darkness,    not    for    the    day. 3335 3334  He    felt    that    if    he    brooded    on    what    he    had    gone    through    he    would    sicken    or    grow    mad.    There    were    sins    whose 3336 3335  fascination    was    more    in    the    memory    than    in    the    doing    of    them,    strange    triumphs    that    gratiﬁed    the    pride    more 3337 3336  than    the    passions,    and    gave    to    the    intellect    a    quickened    sense    of    joy,    greater    than    any    joy    they    brought,    or 3338 3337  could    ever    bring,    to    the    senses.    But    this    was    not    one    of    them.    It    was    a    thing    to    be    driven    out    of    the    mind,    to    be 3339 3338  drugged    with    poppies,    to    be    strangled    lest    it    might    strangle    one    itself. 3340 3339  When    the    half-hour    struck,    he    passed    his    hand    across    his    forehead,    and    then    got    up    hastily    and    dressed 3341 3340  himself    with    even    more    than    his    usual    care,    giving    a    good    deal    of    attention    to    the    choice    of    his    necktie    and 3342 3341  scarf-pin    and    changing    his    rings    more    than    once.    He    spent    a    long    time    also    over    breakfast,    tasting    the    various 3343 3342  dishes,    talking    to    his    valet    about    some    new    liveries    that    he    was    thinking    of    getting    made    for    the    servants    at 3344 3343  Selby,    and    going    through    his    correspondence.    At    some    of    the    letters,    he    smiled.    Three    of    them    bored    him.    One 3345 3344  he    read    several    times    over    and    then    tore    up    with    a    slight    look    of    annoyance    in    his    face.    “That    awful    thing,    a 3346 3345  woman’s    memory!”    as    Lord    Henry    had    once    said. 3347 3346  After    he    had    drunk    his    cup    of    black    coﬀee,    he    wiped    his    lips    slowly    with    a    napkin,    motioned    to    his    servant    to 3348 3347  wait,    and    going    over    to    the    table,    sat    down    and    wrote    two    letters.    One    he    put    in    his    pocket,    the    other    he    handed 3349 3348  to    the    valet. 3350 3349  “Take    this    round    to    152,    Hertford    Street,    Francis,    and    if    Mr.    Campbell    is    out    of    town,    get    his    address.” 3351 3350  As    soon    as    he    was    alone,    he    lit    a    cigarette    and    began    sketching    upon    a    piece    of    paper,    drawing    ﬁrst    ﬂowers 3352 3351  and    bits    of    architecture,    and    then    human    faces.    Suddenly    he    remarked    that    every    face    that    he    drew    seemed    to 3353 3352  have    a    fantastic    likeness    to    Basil    Hallward.    He    frowned,    and    getting    up,    went    over    to    the    book-case    and    took    out 3354 3353  a    volume    at    hazard.    He    was    determined    that    he    would    not    think    about    what    had    happened    until    it    became 3355 3354  absolutely    necessary    that    he    should    do    so. 3356 3355  When    he    had    stretched    himself    on    the    sofa,    he    looked    at    the    title-page    of    the    book.    It    was    Gautier’s    “Émaux 3357 3356  et    Camées”,    Charpentier’s    Japanese-paper    edition,    with    the    Jacquemart    etching.    The    binding    was    of    citron- 3358 3357  green    leather,    with    a    design    of    gilt    trellis-work    and    dotted    pomegranates.    It    had    been    given    to    him    by    Adrian 3359 3358  Singleton.    As    he    turned    over    the    pages,    his    eye    fell    on    the    poem    about    the    hand    of    Lacenaire,    the    cold    yellow 3360 3359  hand    “du    supplice    encore    mal    lavée,”    with    its    downy    red    hairs    and    its    “doigts    de    faune.”    He    glanced    at    his    own 3361 3360  white    taper    ﬁngers,    shuddering    slightly    in    spite    of    himself,    and    passed    on,    till    he    came    to    those    lovely    stanzas 3362 3361  upon    Venice: 3363 3362  Sur    une    gamme    chromatique, 3364 3363  Le    sein    de    perles    ruisselant, 3365 3364  La    Vénus    de    l’Adriatique 3366 3365  Sort    de    l’eau    son    corps    rose    et    blanc. 3367 3366  Les    dômes,    sur    l’azur    des    ondes 3368 3367  Suivant    la    phrase    au    pur    contour, 3369 3368  S’enflent    comme    des    gorges    rondes 3370 3369  Que    soulève    un    soupir    d’amour. 3371 3370  L’esquif    aborde    et    me    dépose, 3372 3371  Jetant    son    amarre    au    pilier, 3373 3372  Devant    une    façade    rose, 3374 3373  Sur    le    marbre    d’un    escalier. 3375 3374  How    exquisite    they    were!    As    one    read    them,    one    seemed    to    be    ﬂoating    down    the    green    water-ways    of    the 3376 3375  pink    and    pearl    city,    seated    in    a    black    gondola    with    silver    prow    and    trailing    curtains.    The    mere    lines    looked    to    him 3377 3376  like    those    straight    lines    of    turquoise-blue    that    follow    one    as    one    pushes    out    to    the    Lido.    The    sudden    ﬂashes    of 3378 3377  colour    reminded    him    of    the    gleam    of    the    opal-and-iris-throated    birds    that    ﬂutter    round    the    tall    honeycombed 3379 3378  Campanile,    or    stalk,    with    such    stately    grace,    through    the    dim,    dust-stained    arcades.    Leaning    back    with    half- 3380 3379  closed    eyes,    he    kept    saying    over    and    over    to    himself: 3381 3380  “Devant    une    façade    rose, 3382 3381  Sur    le    marbre    d’un    escalier.” 3383 3382  The    whole    of    Venice    was    in    those    two    lines.    He    remembered    the    autumn    that    he    had    passed    there,    and    a 3384 3383  wonderful    love    that    had    stirred    him    to    mad    delightful    follies.    There    was    romance    in    every    place.    But    Venice,    like 3385 3384  \\x0cOxford,    had    kept    the    background    for    romance,    and,    to    the    true    romantic,    background    was    everything,    or    almost 3386 3385  everything.    Basil    had    been    with    him    part    of    the    time,    and    had    gone    wild    over    Tintoret.    Poor    Basil!    What    a 3387 3386  horrible    way    for    a    man    to    die! 3388 3387  He    sighed,    and    took    up    the    volume    again,    and    tried    to    forget.    He    read    of    the    swallows    that    ﬂy    in    and    out    of    the 3389 3388  little    café    at    Smyrna    where    the    Hadjis    sit    counting    their    amber    beads    and    the    turbaned    merchants    smoke    their 3390 3389  long    tasselled    pipes    and    talk    gravely    to    each    other;    he    read    of    the    Obelisk    in    the    Place    de    la    Concorde    that 3391 3390  weeps    tears    of    granite    in    its    lonely    sunless    exile    and    longs    to    be    back    by    the    hot,    lotus-covered    Nile,    where    there 3392 3391  are    Sphinxes,    and    rose-red    ibises,    and    white    vultures    with    gilded    claws,    and    crocodiles    with    small    beryl    eyes 3393 3392  that    crawl    over    the    green    steaming    mud;    he    began    to    brood    over    those    verses    which,    drawing    music    from    kiss- 3394 3393  stained    marble,    tell    of    that    curious    statue    that    Gautier    compares    to    a    contralto    voice,    the    “monstre    charmant” 3395 3394  that    couches    in    the    porphyry-room    of    the    Louvre.    But    after    a    time    the    book    fell    from    his    hand.    He    grew    nervous, 3396 3395  and    a    horrible    ﬁt    of    terror    came    over    him.    What    if    Alan    Campbell    should    be    out    of    England?    Days    would    elapse 3397 3396  before    he    could    come    back.    Perhaps    he    might    refuse    to    come.    What    could    he    do    then?    Every    moment    was    of 3398 3397  vital    importance. 3399 3398  They    had    been    great    friends    once,    ﬁve    years    before—almost    inseparable,    indeed.    Then    the    intimacy    had 3400 3399  come    suddenly    to    an    end.    When    they    met    in    society    now,    it    was    only    Dorian    Gray    who    smiled:    Alan    Campbell 3401 3400  never    did. 3402 3401  He    was    an    extremely    clever    young    man,    though    he    had    no    real    appreciation    of    the    visible    arts,    and    whatever 3403 3402  little    sense    of    the    beauty    of    poetry    he    possessed    he    had    gained    entirely    from    Dorian.    His    dominant    intellectual 3404 3403  passion    was    for    science.    At    Cambridge    he    had    spent    a    great    deal    of    his    time    working    in    the    laboratory,    and    had 3405 3404  taken    a    good    class    in    the    Natural    Science    Tripos    of    his    year.    Indeed,    he    was    still    devoted    to    the    study    of 3406 3405  chemistry,    and    had    a    laboratory    of    his    own    in    which    he    used    to    shut    himself    up    all    day    long,    greatly    to    the 3407 3406  annoyance    of    his    mother,    who    had    set    her    heart    on    his    standing    for    Parliament    and    had    a    vague    idea    that    a 3408 3407  chemist    was    a    person    who    made    up    prescriptions.    He    was    an    excellent    musician,    however,    as    well,    and    played 3409 3408  both    the    violin    and    the    piano    better    than    most    amateurs.    In    fact,    it    was    music    that    had    ﬁrst    brought    him    and 3410 3409  Dorian    Gray    together—music    and    that    indeﬁnable    attraction    that    Dorian    seemed    to    be    able    to    exercise 3411 3410  whenever    he    wished—and,    indeed,    exercised    often    without    being    conscious    of    it.    They    had    met    at    Lady 3412 3411  Berkshire’s    the    night    that    Rubinstein    played    there,    and    after    that    used    to    be    always    seen    together    at    the    opera 3413 3412  and    wherever    good    music    was    going    on.    For    eighteen    months    their    intimacy    lasted.    Campbell    was    always    either 3414 3413  at    Selby    Royal    or    in    Grosvenor    Square.    To    him,    as    to    many    others,    Dorian    Gray    was    the    type    of    everything    that 3415 3414  is    wonderful    and    fascinating    in    life.    Whether    or    not    a    quarrel    had    taken    place    between    them    no    one    ever    knew. 3416 3415  But    suddenly    people    remarked    that    they    scarcely    spoke    when    they    met    and    that    Campbell    seemed    always    to    go 3417 3416  away    early    from    any    party    at    which    Dorian    Gray    was    present.    He    had    changed,    too—was    strangely    melancholy 3418 3417  at    times,    appeared    almost    to    dislike    hearing    music,    and    would    never    himself    play,    giving    as    his    excuse,    when    he 3419 3418  was    called    upon,    that    he    was    so    absorbed    in    science    that    he    had    no    time    left    in    which    to    practise.    And    this    was 3420 3419  certainly    true.    Every    day    he    seemed    to    become    more    interested    in    biology,    and    his    name    appeared    once    or 3421 3420  twice    in    some    of    the    scientific    reviews    in    connection    with    certain    curious    experiments. 3422 3421  This    was    the    man    Dorian    Gray    was    waiting    for.    Every    second    he    kept    glancing    at    the    clock.    As    the    minutes 3423 3422  went    by    he    became    horribly    agitated.    At    last    he    got    up    and    began    to    pace    up    and    down    the    room,    looking    like    a 3424 3423  beautiful    caged    thing.    He    took    long    stealthy    strides.    His    hands    were    curiously    cold. 3425 3424  The    suspense    became    unbearable.    Time    seemed    to    him    to    be    crawling    with    feet    of    lead,    while    he    by 3426 3425  monstrous    winds    was    being    swept    towards    the    jagged    edge    of    some    black    cleft    of    precipice.    He    knew    what    was 3427 3426  waiting    for    him    there;    saw    it,    indeed,    and,    shuddering,    crushed    with    dank    hands    his    burning    lids    as    though    he 3428 3427  would    have    robbed    the    very    brain    of    sight    and    driven    the    eyeballs    back    into    their    cave.    It    was    useless.    The    brain 3429 3428  had    its    own    food    on    which    it    battened,    and    the    imagination,    made    grotesque    by    terror,    twisted    and    distorted    as    a 3430 3429  living    thing    by    pain,    danced    like    some    foul    puppet    on    a    stand    and    grinned    through    moving    masks.    Then, 3431 3430  suddenly,    time    stopped    for    him.    Yes:    that    blind,    slow-breathing    thing    crawled    no    more,    and    horrible    thoughts, 3432 3431  time    being    dead,    raced    nimbly    on    in    front,    and    dragged    a    hideous    future    from    its    grave,    and    showed    it    to    him.    He 3433 3432  stared    at    it.    Its    very    horror    made    him    stone. 3434 3433  At    last    the    door    opened    and    his    servant    entered.    He    turned    glazed    eyes    upon    him. 3435 3434  “Mr.    Campbell,    sir,”    said    the    man. 3436 3435  A    sigh    of    relief    broke    from    his    parched    lips,    and    the    colour    came    back    to    his    cheeks. 3437 3436  “Ask    him    to    come    in    at    once,    Francis.”    He    felt    that    he    was    himself    again.    His    mood    of    cowardice    had    passed 3438 3437  away. 3439 3438  The    man    bowed    and    retired.    In    a    few    moments,    Alan    Campbell    walked    in,    looking    very    stern    and    rather    pale, 3440 3439  his    pallor    being    intensified    by    his    coal-black    hair    and    dark    eyebrows. 3441 3440  “Alan!    This    is    kind    of    you.    I    thank    you    for    coming.” 3442 3441  “I    had    intended    never    to    enter    your    house    again,    Gray.    But    you    said    it    was    a    matter    of    life    and    death.”    His 3443 3442  voice    was    hard    and    cold.    He    spoke    with    slow    deliberation.    There    was    a    look    of    contempt    in    the    steady    searching 3444 3443  gaze    that    he    turned    on    Dorian.    He    kept    his    hands    in    the    pockets    of    his    Astrakhan    coat,    and    seemed    not    to    have 3445 3444  noticed    the    gesture    with    which    he    had    been    greeted. 3446 3445  “Yes:    it    is    a    matter    of    life    and    death,    Alan,    and    to    more    than    one    person.    Sit    down.” 3447 3446  Campbell    took    a    chair    by    the    table,    and    Dorian    sat    opposite    to    him.    The    two    men’s    eyes    met.    In    Dorian’s 3448 3447  there    was    infinite    pity.    He    knew    that    what    he    was    going    to    do    was    dreadful. 3449 3448  After    a    strained    moment    of    silence,    he    leaned    across    and    said,    very    quietly,    but    watching    the    eﬀect    of    each 3450 3449  word    upon    the    face    of    him    he    had    sent    for,    “Alan,    in    a    locked    room    at    the    top    of    this    house,    a    room    to    which 3451 3450  nobody    but    myself    has    access,    a    dead    man    is    seated    at    a    table.    He    has    been    dead    ten    hours    now.    Don’t    stir, 3452 3451  and    don’t    look    at    me    like    that.    Who    the    man    is,    why    he    died,    how    he    died,    are    matters    that    do    not    concern    you. 3453 3452  What    you    have    to    do    is    this—” 3454 3453  “Stop,    Gray.    I    don’t    want    to    know    anything    further.    Whether    what    you    have    told    me    is    true    or    not    true    doesn’t 3455 3454  \\x0cconcern    me.    I    entirely    decline    to    be    mixed    up    in    your    life.    Keep    your    horrible    secrets    to    yourself.    They    don’t 3456 3455  interest    me    any    more.” 3457 3456  “Alan,    they    will    have    to    interest    you.    This    one    will    have    to    interest    you.    I    am    awfully    sorry    for    you,    Alan.    But    I 3458 3457  can’t    help    myself.    You    are    the    one    man    who    is    able    to    save    me.    I    am    forced    to    bring    you    into    the    matter.    I    have 3459 3458  no    option.    Alan,    you    are    scientiﬁc.    You    know    about    chemistry    and    things    of    that    kind.    You    have    made 3460 3459  experiments.    What    you    have    got    to    do    is    to    destroy    the    thing    that    is    upstairs—to    destroy    it    so    that    not    a    vestige 3461 3460  of    it    will    be    left.    Nobody    saw    this    person    come    into    the    house.    Indeed,    at    the    present    moment    he    is    supposed    to 3462 3461  be    in    Paris.    He    will    not    be    missed    for    months.    When    he    is    missed,    there    must    be    no    trace    of    him    found    here. 3463 3462  You,    Alan,    you    must    change    him,    and    everything    that    belongs    to    him,    into    a    handful    of    ashes    that    I    may    scatter 3464 3463  in    the    air.” 3465 3464  “You    are    mad,    Dorian.” 3466 3465  “Ah!    I    was    waiting    for    you    to    call    me    Dorian.” 3467 3466  “You    are    mad,    I    tell    you—mad    to    imagine    that    I    would    raise    a    ﬁnger    to    help    you,    mad    to    make    this    monstrous 3468 3467  confession.    I    will    have    nothing    to    do    with    this    matter,    whatever    it    is.    Do    you    think    I    am    going    to    peril    my 3469 3468  reputation    for    you?    What    is    it    to    me    what    devil’s    work    you    are    up    to?” 3470 3469  “It    was    suicide,    Alan.” 3471 3470  “I    am    glad    of    that.    But    who    drove    him    to    it?    You,    I    should    fancy.” 3472 3471  “Do    you    still    refuse    to    do    this    for    me?” 3473 3472  “Of    course    I    refuse.    I    will    have    absolutely    nothing    to    do    with    it.    I    don’t    care    what    shame    comes    on    you.    You 3474 3473  deserve    it    all.    I    should    not    be    sorry    to    see    you    disgraced,    publicly    disgraced.    How    dare    you    ask    me,    of    all    men    in 3475 3474  the    world,    to    mix    myself    up    in    this    horror?    I    should    have    thought    you    knew    more    about    people’s    characters.    Your 3476 3475  friend    Lord    Henry    Wotton    can’t    have    taught    you    much    about    psychology,    whatever    else    he    has    taught    you. 3477 3476  Nothing    will    induce    me    to    stir    a    step    to    help    you.    You    have    come    to    the    wrong    man.    Go    to    some    of    your    friends. 3478 3477  Don’t    come    to    me.” 3479 3478  “Alan,    it    was    murder.    I    killed    him.    You    don’t    know    what    he    had    made    me    suﬀer.    Whatever    my    life    is,    he    had 3480 3479  more    to    do    with    the    making    or    the    marring    of    it    than    poor    Harry    has    had.    He    may    not    have    intended    it,    the    result 3481 3480  was    the    same.” 3482 3481  “Murder!    Good    God,    Dorian,    is    that    what    you    have    come    to?    I    shall    not    inform    upon    you.    It    is    not    my    business. 3483 3482  Besides,    without    my    stirring    in    the    matter,    you    are    certain    to    be    arrested.    Nobody    ever    commits    a    crime    without 3484 3483  doing    something    stupid.    But    I    will    have    nothing    to    do    with    it.” 3485 3484  “You    must    have    something    to    do    with    it.    Wait,    wait    a    moment;    listen    to    me.    Only    listen,    Alan.    All    I    ask    of    you    is 3486 3485  to    perform    a    certain    scientiﬁc    experiment.    You    go    to    hospitals    and    dead-houses,    and    the    horrors    that    you    do 3487 3486  there    don’t    aﬀect    you.    If    in    some    hideous    dissecting-room    or    fetid    laboratory    you    found    this    man    lying    on    a 3488 3487  leaden    table    with    red    gutters    scooped    out    in    it    for    the    blood    to    ﬂow    through,    you    would    simply    look    upon    him    as 3489 3488  an    admirable    subject.    You    would    not    turn    a    hair.    You    would    not    believe    that    you    were    doing    anything    wrong.    On 3490 3489  the    contrary,    you    would    probably    feel    that    you    were    beneﬁting    the    human    race,    or    increasing    the    sum    of 3491 3490  knowledge    in    the    world,    or    gratifying    intellectual    curiosity,    or    something    of    that    kind.    What    I    want    you    to    do    is 3492 3491  merely    what    you    have    often    done    before.    Indeed,    to    destroy    a    body    must    be    far    less    horrible    than    what    you    are 3493 3492  accustomed    to    work    at.    And,    remember,    it    is    the    only    piece    of    evidence    against    me.    If    it    is    discovered,    I    am    lost; 3494 3493  and    it    is    sure    to    be    discovered    unless    you    help    me.” 3495 3494  “I    have    no    desire    to    help    you.    You    forget    that.    I    am    simply    indiﬀerent    to    the    whole    thing.    It    has    nothing    to    do 3496 3495  with    me.” 3497 3496  “Alan,    I    entreat    you.    Think    of    the    position    I    am    in.    Just    before    you    came    I    almost    fainted    with    terror.    You    may 3498 3497  know    terror    yourself    some    day.    No!    don’t    think    of    that.    Look    at    the    matter    purely    from    the    scientiﬁc    point    of    view. 3499 3498  You    don’t    inquire    where    the    dead    things    on    which    you    experiment    come    from.    Don’t    inquire    now.    I    have    told    you 3500 3499  too    much    as    it    is.    But    I    beg    of    you    to    do    this.    We    were    friends    once,    Alan.” 3501 3500  “Don’t    speak    about    those    days,    Dorian—they    are    dead.” 3502 3501  “The    dead    linger    sometimes.    The    man    upstairs    will    not    go    away.    He    is    sitting    at    the    table    with    bowed    head 3503 3502  and    outstretched    arms.    Alan!    Alan!    If    you    don’t    come    to    my    assistance,    I    am    ruined.    Why,    they    will    hang    me, 3504 3503  Alan!    Don’t    you    understand?    They    will    hang    me    for    what    I    have    done.” 3505 3504  “There    is    no    good    in    prolonging    this    scene.    I    absolutely    refuse    to    do    anything    in    the    matter.    It    is    insane    of    you 3506 3505  to    ask    me.” 3507 3506  “You    refuse?” 3508 3507  “Yes.” 3509 3508  “I    entreat    you,    Alan.” 3510 3509  “It    is    useless.” 3511 3510  The    same    look    of    pity    came    into    Dorian    Gray’s    eyes.    Then    he    stretched    out    his    hand,    took    a    piece    of    paper, 3512 3511  and    wrote    something    on    it.    He    read    it    over    twice,    folded    it    carefully,    and    pushed    it    across    the    table.    Having    done 3513 3512  this,    he    got    up    and    went    over    to    the    window. 3514 3513  Campbell    looked    at    him    in    surprise,    and    then    took    up    the    paper,    and    opened    it.    As    he    read    it,    his    face    became 3515 3514  ghastly    pale    and    he    fell    back    in    his    chair.    A    horrible    sense    of    sickness    came    over    him.    He    felt    as    if    his    heart    was 3516 3515  beating    itself    to    death    in    some    empty    hollow. 3517 3516  After    two    or    three    minutes    of    terrible    silence,    Dorian    turned    round    and    came    and    stood    behind    him,    putting    his 3518 3517  hand    upon    his    shoulder. 3519 3518  “I    am    so    sorry    for    you,    Alan,”    he    murmured,    “but    you    leave    me    no    alternative.    I    have    a    letter    written    already. 3520 3519  Here    it    is.    You    see    the    address.    If    you    don’t    help    me,    I    must    send    it.    If    you    don’t    help    me,    I    will    send    it.    You    kn 3521 3520  what    the    result    will    be.    But    you    are    going    to    help    me.    It    is    impossible    for    you    to    refuse    now.    I    tried    to    spare    you. 3522 3521  You    will    do    me    the    justice    to    admit    that.    You    were    stern,    harsh,    oﬀensive.    You    treated    me    as    no    man    has    ever 3523 3522  \\x0cdared    to    treat    me—no    living    man,    at    any    rate.    I    bore    it    all.    Now    it    is    for    me    to    dictate    terms.” 3524 3523  Campbell    buried    his    face    in    his    hands,    and    a    shudder    passed    through    him. 3525 3524  “Yes,    it    is    my    turn    to    dictate    terms,    Alan.    You    know    what    they    are.    The    thing    is    quite    simple.    Come,    don’t    work 3526 3525  yourself    into    this    fever.    The    thing    has    to    be    done.    Face    it,    and    do    it.” 3527 3526  A    groan    broke    from    Campbell’s    lips    and    he    shivered    all    over.    The    ticking    of    the    clock    on    the    mantelpiece 3528 3527  seemed    to    him    to    be    dividing    time    into    separate    atoms    of    agony,    each    of    which    was    too    terrible    to    be    borne.    He 3529 3528  felt    as    if    an    iron    ring    was    being    slowly    tightened    round    his    forehead,    as    if    the    disgrace    with    which    he    was 3530 3529  threatened    had    already    come    upon    him.    The    hand    upon    his    shoulder    weighed    like    a    hand    of    lead.    It    was 3531 3530  intolerable.    It    seemed    to    crush    him. 3532 3531  “Come,    Alan,    you    must    decide    at    once.” 3533 3532  “I    cannot    do    it,”    he    said,    mechanically,    as    though    words    could    alter    things. 3534 3533  “You    must.    You    have    no    choice.    Don’t    delay.” 3535 3534  He    hesitated    a    moment.    “Is    there    a    fire    in    the    room    upstairs?” 3536 3535  “Yes,    there    is    a    gas-fire    with    asbestos.” 3537 3536  “I    shall    have    to    go    home    and    get    some    things    from    the    laboratory.” 3538 3537  “No,    Alan,    you    must    not    leave    the    house.    Write    out    on    a    sheet    of    notepaper    what    you    want    and    my    servant 3539 3538  will    take    a    cab    and    bring    the    things    back    to    you.” 3540 3539  Campbell    scrawled    a    few    lines,    blotted    them,    and    addressed    an    envelope    to    his    assistant.    Dorian    took    the 3541 3540  note    up    and    read    it    carefully.    Then    he    rang    the    bell    and    gave    it    to    his    valet,    with    orders    to    return    as    soon    as 3542 3541  possible    and    to    bring    the    things    with    him. 3543 3542  As    the    hall    door    shut,    Campbell    started    nervously,    and    having    got    up    from    the    chair,    went    over    to    the 3544 3543  chimney-piece.    He    was    shivering    with    a    kind    of    ague.    For    nearly    twenty    minutes,    neither    of    the    men    spoke.    A    ﬂy 3545 3544  buzzed    noisily    about    the    room,    and    the    ticking    of    the    clock    was    like    the    beat    of    a    hammer. 3546 3545  As    the    chime    struck    one,    Campbell    turned    round,    and    looking    at    Dorian    Gray,    saw    that    his    eyes    were    ﬁlled 3547 3546  with    tears.    There    was    something    in    the    purity    and    reﬁnement    of    that    sad    face    that    seemed    to    enrage    him.    “You 3548 3547  are    infamous,    absolutely    infamous!”    he    muttered. 3549 3548  “Hush,    Alan.    You    have    saved    my    life,”    said    Dorian. 3550 3549  “Your    life?    Good    heavens!    what    a    life    that    is!    You    have    gone    from    corruption    to    corruption,    and    now    you    have 3551 3550  culminated    in    crime.    In    doing    what    I    am    going    to    do—what    you    force    me    to    do—it    is    not    of    your    life    that    I    am 3552 3551  thinking.” 3553 3552  “Ah,    Alan,”    murmured    Dorian    with    a    sigh,    “I    wish    you    had    a    thousandth    part    of    the    pity    for    me    that    I    have    for 3554 3553  you.”    He    turned    away    as    he    spoke    and    stood    looking    out    at    the    garden.    Campbell    made    no    answer. 3555 3554  After    about    ten    minutes    a    knock    came    to    the    door,    and    the    servant    entered,    carrying    a    large    mahogany    chest 3556 3555  of    chemicals,    with    a    long    coil    of    steel    and    platinum    wire    and    two    rather    curiously    shaped    iron    clamps. 3557 3556  “Shall    I    leave    the    things    here,    sir?”    he    asked    Campbell. 3558 3557  “Yes,”    said    Dorian.    “And    I    am    afraid,    Francis,    that    I    have    another    errand    for    you.    What    is    the    name    of    the    man 3559 3558  at    Richmond    who    supplies    Selby    with    orchids?” 3560 3559  “Harden,    sir.” 3561 3560  “Yes—Harden.    You    must    go    down    to    Richmond    at    once,    see    Harden    personally,    and    tell    him    to    send    twice    as 3562 3561  many    orchids    as    I    ordered,    and    to    have    as    few    white    ones    as    possible.    In    fact,    I    don’t    want    any    white    ones.    It    is 3563 3562  a    lovely    day,    Francis,    and    Richmond    is    a    very    pretty    place—otherwise    I    wouldn’t    bother    you    about    it.” 3564 3563  “No    trouble,    sir.    At    what    time    shall    I    be    back?” 3565 3564  Dorian    looked    at    Campbell.    “How    long    will    your    experiment    take,    Alan?”    he    said    in    a    calm    indiﬀerent    voice. 3566 3565  The    presence    of    a    third    person    in    the    room    seemed    to    give    him    extraordinary    courage. 3567 3566  Campbell    frowned    and    bit    his    lip.    “It    will    take    about    five    hours,”    he    answered. 3568 3567  “It    will    be    time    enough,    then,    if    you    are    back    at    half-past    seven,    Francis.    Or    stay:    just    leave    my    things    out    for 3569 3568  dressing.    You    can    have    the    evening    to    yourself.    I    am    not    dining    at    home,    so    I    shall    not    want    you.” 3570 3569  “Thank    you,    sir,”    said    the    man,    leaving    the    room. 3571 3570  “Now,    Alan,    there    is    not    a    moment    to    be    lost.    How    heavy    this    chest    is!    I’ll    take    it    for    you.    You    bring    the    other 3572 3571  things.”    He    spoke    rapidly    and    in    an    authoritative    manner.    Campbell    felt    dominated    by    him.    They    left    the    room 3573 3572  together. 3574 3573  When    they    reached    the    top    landing,    Dorian    took    out    the    key    and    turned    it    in    the    lock.    Then    he    stopped,    and    a 3575 3574  troubled    look    came    into    his    eyes.    He    shuddered.    “I    don’t    think    I    can    go    in,    Alan,”    he    murmured. 3576 3575  “It    is    nothing    to    me.    I    don’t    require    you,”    said    Campbell    coldly. 3577 3576  Dorian    half    opened    the    door.    As    he    did    so,    he    saw    the    face    of    his    portrait    leering    in    the    sunlight.    On    the    ﬂoor 3578 3577  in    front    of    it    the    torn    curtain    was    lying.    He    remembered    that    the    night    before    he    had    forgotten,    for    the    ﬁrst    time    in 3579 3578  his    life,    to    hide    the    fatal    canvas,    and    was    about    to    rush    forward,    when    he    drew    back    with    a    shudder. 3580 3579  What    was    that    loathsome    red    dew    that    gleamed,    wet    and    glistening,    on    one    of    the    hands,    as    though    the 3581 3580  canvas    had    sweated    blood?    How    horrible    it    was!—more    horrible,    it    seemed    to    him    for    the    moment,    than    the 3582 3581  silent    thing    that    he    knew    was    stretched    across    the    table,    the    thing    whose    grotesque    misshapen    shadow    on    the 3583 3582  spotted    carpet    showed    him    that    it    had    not    stirred,    but    was    still    there,    as    he    had    left    it. 3584 3583  He    heaved    a    deep    breath,    opened    the    door    a    little    wider,    and    with    half-closed    eyes    and    averted    head,    walked 3585 3584  quickly    in,    determined    that    he    would    not    look    even    once    upon    the    dead    man.    Then,    stooping    down    and    taking    up 3586 3585  the    gold-and-purple    hanging,    he    flung    it    right    over    the    picture. 3587 3586  There    he    stopped,    feeling    afraid    to    turn    round,    and    his    eyes    ﬁxed    themselves    on    the    intricacies    of    the    pattern 3588 3587  before    him.    He    heard    Campbell    bringing    in    the    heavy    chest,    and    the    irons,    and    the    other    things    that    he    had 3589 3588  required    for    his    dreadful    work.    He    began    to    wonder    if    he    and    Basil    Hallward    had    ever    met,    and,    if    so,    what    they 3590 3589  \\x0chad    thought    of    each    other. 3591 3590  “Leave    me    now,”    said    a    stern    voice    behind    him. 3592 3591  He    turned    and    hurried    out,    just    conscious    that    the    dead    man    had    been    thrust    back    into    the    chair    and    that 3593 3592  Campbell    was    gazing    into    a    glistening    yellow    face.    As    he    was    going    downstairs,    he    heard    the    key    being    turned 3594 3593  in    the    lock. 3595 3594  It    was    long    after    seven    when    Campbell    came    back    into    the    library.    He    was    pale,    but    absolutely    calm.    “I    have 3596 3595  done    what    you    asked    me    to    do,”    he    muttered.    “And    now,    good-bye.    Let    us    never    see    each    other    again.” 3597 3596  “You    have    saved    me    from    ruin,    Alan.    I    cannot    forget    that,”    said    Dorian    simply. 3598 3597  As    soon    as    Campbell    had    left,    he    went    upstairs.    There    was    a    horrible    smell    of    nitric    acid    in    the    room.    But    the 3599 3598  thing    that    had    been    sitting    at    the    table    was    gone. 3600 3599  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                            CHAPTER    XV. 3601 3600  That    evening,    at    eight-thirty,    exquisitely    dressed    and    wearing    a    large    button-hole    of    Parma    violets,    Dorian 3602 3601  Gray    was    ushered    into    Lady    Narborough’s    drawing-room    by    bowing    servants.    His    forehead    was    throbbing    with 3603 3602  maddened    nerves,    and    he    felt    wildly    excited,    but    his    manner    as    he    bent    over    his    hostess’s    hand    was    as    easy 3604 3603  and    graceful    as    ever.    Perhaps    one    never    seems    so    much    at    one’s    ease    as    when    one    has    to    play    a    part. 3605 3604  Certainly    no    one    looking    at    Dorian    Gray    that    night    could    have    believed    that    he    had    passed    through    a    tragedy    as 3606 3605  horrible    as    any    tragedy    of    our    age.    Those    ﬁnely    shaped    ﬁngers    could    never    have    clutched    a    knife    for    sin,    nor 3607 3606  those    smiling    lips    have    cried    out    on    God    and    goodness.    He    himself    could    not    help    wondering    at    the    calm    of    his 3608 3607  demeanour,    and    for    a    moment    felt    keenly    the    terrible    pleasure    of    a    double    life. 3609 3608  It    was    a    small    party,    got    up    rather    in    a    hurry    by    Lady    Narborough,    who    was    a    very    clever    woman    with    what 3610 3609  Lord    Henry    used    to    describe    as    the    remains    of    really    remarkable    ugliness.    She    had    proved    an    excellent    wife    to 3611 3610  one    of    our    most    tedious    ambassadors,    and    having    buried    her    husband    properly    in    a    marble    mausoleum,    which 3612 3611  she    had    herself    designed,    and    married    oﬀ    her    daughters    to    some    rich,    rather    elderly    men,    she    devoted    herself 3613 3612  now    to    the    pleasures    of    French    fiction,    French    cookery,    and    French    esprit    when    she    could    get    it. 3614 3613  Dorian    was    one    of    her    especial    favourites,    and    she    always    told    him    that    she    was    extremely    glad    she    had    not 3615 3614  met    him    in    early    life.    “I    know,    my    dear,    I    should    have    fallen    madly    in    love    with    you,”    she    used    to    say,    “and    thrown 3616 3615  my    bonnet    right    over    the    mills    for    your    sake.    It    is    most    fortunate    that    you    were    not    thought    of    at    the    time.    As    it 3617 3616  was,    our    bonnets    were    so    unbecoming,    and    the    mills    were    so    occupied    in    trying    to    raise    the    wind,    that    I    never 3618 3617  had    even    a    ﬂirtation    with    anybody.    However,    that    was    all    Narborough’s    fault.    He    was    dreadfully    short-sighted, 3619 3618  and    there    is    no    pleasure    in    taking    in    a    husband    who    never    sees    anything.” 3620 3619  Her    guests    this    evening    were    rather    tedious.    The    fact    was,    as    she    explained    to    Dorian,    behind    a    very    shabby 3621 3620  fan,    one    of    her    married    daughters    had    come    up    quite    suddenly    to    stay    with    her,    and,    to    make    matters    worse, 3622 3621  had    actually    brought    her    husband    with    her.    “I    think    it    is    most    unkind    of    her,    my    dear,”    she    whispered.    “Of    course 3623 3622  I    go    and    stay    with    them    every    summer    after    I    come    from    Homburg,    but    then    an    old    woman    like    me    must    have 3624 3623  fresh    air    sometimes,    and    besides,    I    really    wake    them    up.    You    don’t    know    what    an    existence    they    lead    down 3625 3624  there.    It    is    pure    unadulterated    country    life.    They    get    up    early,    because    they    have    so    much    to    do,    and    go    to    bed 3626 3625  early,    because    they    have    so    little    to    think    about.    There    has    not    been    a    scandal    in    the    neighbourhood    since    the 3627 3626  time    of    Queen    Elizabeth,    and    consequently    they    all    fall    asleep    after    dinner.    You    shan’t    sit    next    either    of    them. 3628 3627  You    shall    sit    by    me    and    amuse    me.” 3629 3628  Dorian    murmured    a    graceful    compliment    and    looked    round    the    room.    Yes:    it    was    certainly    a    tedious    party.    Two 3630 3629  of    the    people    he    had    never    seen    before,    and    the    others    consisted    of    Ernest    Harrowden,    one    of    those    middle- 3631 3630  aged    mediocrities    so    common    in    London    clubs    who    have    no    enemies,    but    are    thoroughly    disliked    by    their 3632 3631  friends;    Lady    Ruxton,    an    overdressed    woman    of    forty-seven,    with    a    hooked    nose,    who    was    always    trying    to    get 3633 3632  herself    compromised,    but    was    so    peculiarly    plain    that    to    her    great    disappointment    no    one    would    ever    believe 3634 3633  anything    against    her;    Mrs.    Erlynne,    a    pushing    nobody,    with    a    delightful    lisp    and    Venetian-red    hair;    Lady    Alice 3635 3634  Chapman,    his    hostess’s    daughter,    a    dowdy    dull    girl,    with    one    of    those    characteristic    British    faces    that,    once 3636 3635  seen,    are    never    remembered;    and    her    husband,    a    red-cheeked,    white-whiskered    creature    who,    like    so    many    of 3637 3636  his    class,    was    under    the    impression    that    inordinate    joviality    can    atone    for    an    entire    lack    of    ideas. 3638 3637  He    was    rather    sorry    he    had    come,    till    Lady    Narborough,    looking    at    the    great    ormolu    gilt    clock    that    sprawled    in 3639 3638  gaudy    curves    on    the    mauve-draped    mantelshelf,    exclaimed:    “How    horrid    of    Henry    Wotton    to    be    so    late!    I    sent 3640 3639  round    to    him    this    morning    on    chance    and    he    promised    faithfully    not    to    disappoint    me.” 3641 3640  It    was    some    consolation    that    Harry    was    to    be    there,    and    when    the    door    opened    and    he    heard    his    slow    musical 3642 3641  voice    lending    charm    to    some    insincere    apology,    he    ceased    to    feel    bored. 3643 3642  But    at    dinner    he    could    not    eat    anything.    Plate    after    plate    went    away    untasted.    Lady    Narborough    kept    scolding 3644 3643  him    for    what    she    called    “an    insult    to    poor    Adolphe,    who    invented    the    menu    specially    for    you,”    and    now    and    then 3645 3644  Lord    Henry    looked    across    at    him,    wondering    at    his    silence    and    abstracted    manner.    From    time    to    time    the    butler 3646 3645  filled    his    glass    with    champagne.    He    drank    eagerly,    and    his    thirst    seemed    to    increase. 3647 3646  “Dorian,”    said    Lord    Henry    at    last,    as    the    chaud-froid    was    being    handed    round,    “what    is    the    matter    with    you    to- 3648 3647  night?    You    are    quite    out    of    sorts.” 3649 3648  “I    believe    he    is    in    love,”    cried    Lady    Narborough,    “and    that    he    is    afraid    to    tell    me    for    fear    I    should    be    jealous.    He 3650 3649  is    quite    right.    I    certainly    should.” 3651 3650  “Dear    Lady    Narborough,”    murmured    Dorian,    smiling,    “I    have    not    been    in    love    for    a    whole    week—not,    in    fact, 3652 3651  since    Madame    de    Ferrol    left    town.” 3653 3652  “How    you    men    can    fall    in    love    with    that    woman!”    exclaimed    the    old    lady.    “I    really    cannot    understand    it.” 3654 3653  “It    is    simply    because    she    remembers    you    when    you    were    a    little    girl,    Lady    Narborough,”    said    Lord    Henry.    “She 3655 3654  is    the    one    link    between    us    and    your    short    frocks.” 3656 3655  “She    does    not    remember    my    short    frocks    at    all,    Lord    Henry.    But    I    remember    her    very    well    at    Vienna    thirty 3657 3656  years    ago,    and    how    décolletée    she    was    then.” 3658 3657  “She    is    still    décolletée,”    he    answered,    taking    an    olive    in    his    long    ﬁngers;    “and    when    she    is    in    a    very    smart 3659 3658  gown    she    looks    like    an    édition    de    luxe    of    a    bad    French    novel.    She    is    really    wonderful,    and    full    of    surprises.    Her 3660 3659  capacity    for    family    aﬀection    is    extraordinary.    When    her    third    husband    died,    her    hair    turned    quite    gold    from    grief.” 3661 3660  “How    can    you,    Harry!”    cried    Dorian. 3662 3661  “It    is    a    most    romantic    explanation,”    laughed    the    hostess.    “But    her    third    husband,    Lord    Henry!    You    don’t    mean 3663 3662  to    say    Ferrol    is    the    fourth?” 3664 3663  “Certainly,    Lady    Narborough.” 3665 3664  “I    don’t    believe    a    word    of    it.” 3666 3665  “Well,    ask    Mr.    Gray.    He    is    one    of    her    most    intimate    friends.” 3667 3666  \\x0c            “Is    it    true,    Mr.    Gray?” 3668 3667  “She    assures    me    so,    Lady    Narborough,”    said    Dorian.    “I    asked    her    whether,    like    Marguerite    de    Navarre,    she 3669 3668  had    their    hearts    embalmed    and    hung    at    her    girdle.    She    told    me    she    didn’t,    because    none    of    them    had    had    any 3670 3669  hearts    at    all.” 3671 3670  “Four    husbands!    Upon    my    word    that    is    trop    de    zêle.” 3672 3671  “Trop    d’audace,    I    tell    her,”    said    Dorian. 3673 3672  “Oh!    she    is    audacious    enough    for    anything,    my    dear.    And    what    is    Ferrol    like?    I    don’t    know    him.” 3674 3673  “The    husbands    of    very    beautiful    women    belong    to    the    criminal    classes,”    said    Lord    Henry,    sipping    his    wine. 3675 3674  Lady    Narborough    hit    him    with    her    fan.    “Lord    Henry,    I    am    not    at    all    surprised    that    the    world    says    that    you    are 3676 3675  extremely    wicked.” 3677 3676  “But    what    world    says    that?”    asked    Lord    Henry,    elevating    his    eyebrows.    “It    can    only    be    the    next    world.    This 3678 3677  world    and    I    are    on    excellent    terms.” 3679 3678  “Everybody    I    know    says    you    are    very    wicked,”    cried    the    old    lady,    shaking    her    head. 3680 3679  Lord    Henry    looked    serious    for    some    moments.    “It    is    perfectly    monstrous,”    he    said,    at    last,    “the    way    people    go 3681 3680  about    nowadays    saying    things    against    one    behind    one’s    back    that    are    absolutely    and    entirely    true.” 3682 3681  “Isn’t    he    incorrigible?”    cried    Dorian,    leaning    forward    in    his    chair. 3683 3682  “I    hope    so,”    said    his    hostess,    laughing.    “But    really,    if    you    all    worship    Madame    de    Ferrol    in    this    ridiculous    way,    I 3684 3683  shall    have    to    marry    again    so    as    to    be    in    the    fashion.” 3685 3684  “You    will    never    marry    again,    Lady    Narborough,”    broke    in    Lord    Henry.    “You    were    far    too    happy.    When    a 3686 3685  woman    marries    again,    it    is    because    she    detested    her    ﬁrst    husband.    When    a    man    marries    again,    it    is    because    he 3687 3686  adored    his    first    wife.    Women    try    their    luck;    men    risk    theirs.” 3688 3687  “Narborough    wasn’t    perfect,”    cried    the    old    lady. 3689 3688  “If    he    had    been,    you    would    not    have    loved    him,    my    dear    lady,”    was    the    rejoinder.    “Women    love    us    for    our 3690 3689  defects.    If    we    have    enough    of    them,    they    will    forgive    us    everything,    even    our    intellects.    You    will    never    ask    me    to 3691 3690  dinner    again    after    saying    this,    I    am    afraid,    Lady    Narborough,    but    it    is    quite    true.” 3692 3691  “Of    course    it    is    true,    Lord    Henry.    If    we    women    did    not    love    you    for    your    defects,    where    would    you    all    be?    Not 3693 3692  one    of    you    would    ever    be    married.    You    would    be    a    set    of    unfortunate    bachelors.    Not,    however,    that    that    would 3694 3693  alter    you    much.    Nowadays    all    the    married    men    live    like    bachelors,    and    all    the    bachelors    like    married    men.” 3695 3694  “Fin    de    siêcle,”    murmured    Lord    Henry. 3696 3695  “Fin    du    globe,”    answered    his    hostess. 3697 3696  “I    wish    it    were    fin    du    globe,”    said    Dorian    with    a    sigh.    “Life    is    a    great    disappointment.” 3698 3697  “Ah,    my    dear,”    cried    Lady    Narborough,    putting    on    her    gloves,    “don’t    tell    me    that    you    have    exhausted    life. 3699 3698  When    a    man    says    that    one    knows    that    life    has    exhausted    him.    Lord    Henry    is    very    wicked,    and    I    sometimes    wish 3700 3699  that    I    had    been;    but    you    are    made    to    be    good—you    look    so    good.    I    must    ﬁnd    you    a    nice    wife.    Lord    Henry,    don’t 3701 3700  you    think    that    Mr.    Gray    should    get    married?” 3702 3701  “I    am    always    telling    him    so,    Lady    Narborough,”    said    Lord    Henry    with    a    bow. 3703 3702  “Well,    we    must    look    out    for    a    suitable    match    for    him.    I    shall    go    through    Debrett    carefully    to-night    and    draw    out 3704 3703  a    list    of    all    the    eligible    young    ladies.” 3705 3704  “With    their    ages,    Lady    Narborough?”    asked    Dorian. 3706 3705  “Of    course,    with    their    ages,    slightly    edited.    But    nothing    must    be    done    in    a    hurry.    I    want    it    to    be    what    The 3707 3706  Morning    Post    calls    a    suitable    alliance,    and    I    want    you    both    to    be    happy.” 3708 3707  “What    nonsense    people    talk    about    happy    marriages!”    exclaimed    Lord    Henry.    “A    man    can    be    happy    with    any 3709 3708  woman,    as    long    as    he    does    not    love    her.” 3710 3709  “Ah!    what    a    cynic    you    are!”    cried    the    old    lady,    pushing    back    her    chair    and    nodding    to    Lady    Ruxton.    “You    must 3711 3710  come    and    dine    with    me    soon    again.    You    are    really    an    admirable    tonic,    much    better    than    what    Sir    Andrew 3712 3711  prescribes    for    me.    You    must    tell    me    what    people    you    would    like    to    meet,    though.    I    want    it    to    be    a    delightful 3713 3712  gathering.” 3714 3713  “I    like    men    who    have    a    future    and    women    who    have    a    past,”    he    answered.    “Or    do    you    think    that    would    make    it 3715 3714  a    petticoat    party?” 3716 3715  “I    fear    so,”    she    said,    laughing,    as    she    stood    up.    “A    thousand    pardons,    my    dear    Lady    Ruxton,”    she    added,    “I 3717 3716  didn’t    see    you    hadn’t    finished    your    cigarette.” 3718 3717  “Never    mind,    Lady    Narborough.    I    smoke    a    great    deal    too    much.    I    am    going    to    limit    myself,    for    the    future.” 3719 3718  “Pray    don’t,    Lady    Ruxton,”    said    Lord    Henry.    “Moderation    is    a    fatal    thing.    Enough    is    as    bad    as    a    meal.    More 3720 3719  than    enough    is    as    good    as    a    feast.” 3721 3720  Lady    Ruxton    glanced    at    him    curiously.    “You    must    come    and    explain    that    to    me    some    afternoon,    Lord    Henry.    It 3722 3721  sounds    a    fascinating    theory,”    she    murmured,    as    she    swept    out    of    the    room. 3723 3722  “Now,    mind    you    don’t    stay    too    long    over    your    politics    and    scandal,”    cried    Lady    Narborough    from    the    door.    “If 3724 3723  you    do,    we    are    sure    to    squabble    upstairs.” 3725 3724  The    men    laughed,    and    Mr.    Chapman    got    up    solemnly    from    the    foot    of    the    table    and    came    up    to    the    top. 3726 3725  Dorian    Gray    changed    his    seat    and    went    and    sat    by    Lord    Henry.    Mr.    Chapman    began    to    talk    in    a    loud    voice 3727 3726  about    the    situation    in    the    House    of    Commons.    He    guﬀawed    at    his    adversaries.    The    word    doctrinaire—word    full 3728 3727  of    terror    to    the    British    mind—reappeared    from    time    to    time    between    his    explosions.    An    alliterative    preﬁx    served 3729 3728  as    an    ornament    of    oratory.    He    hoisted    the    Union    Jack    on    the    pinnacles    of    thought.    The    inherited    stupidity    of    the 3730 3729  race—sound    English    common    sense    he    jovially    termed    it—was    shown    to    be    the    proper    bulwark    for    society. 3731 3730  A    smile    curved    Lord    Henry’s    lips,    and    he    turned    round    and    looked    at    Dorian. 3732 3731  “Are    you    better,    my    dear    fellow?”    he    asked.    “You    seemed    rather    out    of    sorts    at    dinner.” 3733 3732  \\x0c            “I    am    quite    well,    Harry.    I    am    tired.    That    is    all.” 3734 3733  “You    were    charming    last    night.    The    little    duchess    is    quite    devoted    to    you.    She    tells    me    she    is    going    down    to 3735 3734  Selby.” 3736 3735  “She    has    promised    to    come    on    the    twentieth.” 3737 3736  “Is    Monmouth    to    be    there,    too?” 3738 3737  “Oh,    yes,    Harry.” 3739 3738  “He    bores    me    dreadfully,    almost    as    much    as    he    bores    her.    She    is    very    clever,    too    clever    for    a    woman.    She 3740 3739  lacks    the    indeﬁnable    charm    of    weakness.    It    is    the    feet    of    clay    that    make    the    gold    of    the    image    precious.    Her    feet 3741 3740  are    very    pretty,    but    they    are    not    feet    of    clay.    White    porcelain    feet,    if    you    like.    They    have    been    through    the    ﬁre, 3742 3741  and    what    fire    does    not    destroy,    it    hardens.    She    has    had    experiences.” 3743 3742  “How    long    has    she    been    married?”    asked    Dorian. 3744 3743  “An    eternity,    she    tells    me.    I    believe,    according    to    the    peerage,    it    is    ten    years,    but    ten    years    with    Monmouth 3745 3744  must    have    been    like    eternity,    with    time    thrown    in.    Who    else    is    coming?” 3746 3745  “Oh,    the    Willoughbys,    Lord    Rugby    and    his    wife,    our    hostess,    Geoﬀrey    Clouston,    the    usual    set.    I    have    asked 3747 3746  Lord    Grotrian.” 3748 3747  “I    like    him,”    said    Lord    Henry.    “A    great    many    people    don’t,    but    I    ﬁnd    him    charming.    He    atones    for    being 3749 3748  occasionally    somewhat    overdressed    by    being    always    absolutely    over-educated.    He    is    a    very    modern    type.” 3750 3749  “I    don’t    know    if    he    will    be    able    to    come,    Harry.    He    may    have    to    go    to    Monte    Carlo    with    his    father.” 3751 3750  “Ah!    what    a    nuisance    people’s    people    are!    Try    and    make    him    come.    By    the    way,    Dorian,    you    ran    oﬀ    very    early 3752 3751  last    night.    You    left    before    eleven.    What    did    you    do    afterwards?    Did    you    go    straight    home?” 3753 3752  Dorian    glanced    at    him    hurriedly    and    frowned. 3754 3753  “No,    Harry,”    he    said    at    last,    “I    did    not    get    home    till    nearly    three.” 3755 3754  “Did    you    go    to    the    club?” 3756 3755  “Yes,”    he    answered.    Then    he    bit    his    lip.    “No,    I    don’t    mean    that.    I    didn’t    go    to    the    club.    I    walked    about.    I    forget 3757 3756  what    I    did....    How    inquisitive    you    are,    Harry!    You    always    want    to    know    what    one    has    been    doing.    I    always    want 3758 3757  to    forget    what    I    have    been    doing.    I    came    in    at    half-past    two,    if    you    wish    to    know    the    exact    time.    I    had    left    my 3759 3758  latch-key    at    home,    and    my    servant    had    to    let    me    in.    If    you    want    any    corroborative    evidence    on    the    subject,    you 3760 3759  can    ask    him.” 3761 3760  Lord    Henry    shrugged    his    shoulders.    “My    dear    fellow,    as    if    I    cared!    Let    us    go    up    to    the    drawing-room.    No 3762 3761  sherry,    thank    you,    Mr.    Chapman.    Something    has    happened    to    you,    Dorian.    Tell    me    what    it    is.    You    are    not 3763 3762  yourself    to-night.” 3764 3763  “Don’t    mind    me,    Harry.    I    am    irritable,    and    out    of    temper.    I    shall    come    round    and    see    you    to-morrow,    or    next 3765 3764  day.    Make    my    excuses    to    Lady    Narborough.    I    shan’t    go    upstairs.    I    shall    go    home.    I    must    go    home.” 3766 3765  “All    right,    Dorian.    I    dare    say    I    shall    see    you    to-morrow    at    tea-time.    The    duchess    is    coming.” 3767 3766  “I    will    try    to    be    there,    Harry,”    he    said,    leaving    the    room.    As    he    drove    back    to    his    own    house,    he    was    conscious 3768 3767  that    the    sense    of    terror    he    thought    he    had    strangled    had    come    back    to    him.    Lord    Henry’s    casual    questioning 3769 3768  had    made    him    lose    his    nerve    for    the    moment,    and    he    wanted    his    nerve    still.    Things    that    were    dangerous    had    to 3770 3769  be    destroyed.    He    winced.    He    hated    the    idea    of    even    touching    them. 3771 3770  Yet    it    had    to    be    done.    He    realized    that,    and    when    he    had    locked    the    door    of    his    library,    he    opened    the    secret 3772 3771  press    into    which    he    had    thrust    Basil    Hallward’s    coat    and    bag.    A    huge    ﬁre    was    blazing.    He    piled    another    log    on    it. 3773 3772  The    smell    of    the    singeing    clothes    and    burning    leather    was    horrible.    It    took    him    three-quarters    of    an    hour    to 3774 3773  consume    everything.    At    the    end    he    felt    faint    and    sick,    and    having    lit    some    Algerian    pastilles    in    a    pierced    copper 3775 3774  brazier,    he    bathed    his    hands    and    forehead    with    a    cool    musk-scented    vinegar. 3776 3775  Suddenly    he    started.    His    eyes    grew    strangely    bright,    and    he    gnawed    nervously    at    his    underlip.    Between    two 3777 3776  of    the    windows    stood    a    large    Florentine    cabinet,    made    out    of    ebony    and    inlaid    with    ivory    and    blue    lapis.    He 3778 3777  watched    it    as    though    it    were    a    thing    that    could    fascinate    and    make    afraid,    as    though    it    held    something    that    he 3779 3778  longed    for    and    yet    almost    loathed.    His    breath    quickened.    A    mad    craving    came    over    him.    He    lit    a    cigarette    and 3780 3779  then    threw    it    away.    His    eyelids    drooped    till    the    long    fringed    lashes    almost    touched    his    cheek.    But    he    still 3781 3780  watched    the    cabinet.    At    last    he    got    up    from    the    sofa    on    which    he    had    been    lying,    went    over    to    it,    and    having 3782 3781  unlocked    it,    touched    some    hidden    spring.    A    triangular    drawer    passed    slowly    out.    His    ﬁngers    moved    instinctively 3783 3782  towards    it,    dipped    in,    and    closed    on    something.    It    was    a    small    Chinese    box    of    black    and    gold-dust    lacquer, 3784 3783  elaborately    wrought,    the    sides    patterned    with    curved    waves,    and    the    silken    cords    hung    with    round    crystals    and 3785 3784  tasselled    in    plaited    metal    threads.    He    opened    it.    Inside    was    a    green    paste,    waxy    in    lustre,    the    odour    curiously 3786 3785  heavy    and    persistent. 3787 3786  He    hesitated    for    some    moments,    with    a    strangely    immobile    smile    upon    his    face.    Then    shivering,    though    the 3788 3787  atmosphere    of    the    room    was    terribly    hot,    he    drew    himself    up    and    glanced    at    the    clock.    It    was    twenty    minutes    to 3789 3788  twelve.    He    put    the    box    back,    shutting    the    cabinet    doors    as    he    did    so,    and    went    into    his    bedroom. 3790 3789  As    midnight    was    striking    bronze    blows    upon    the    dusky    air,    Dorian    Gray,    dressed    commonly,    and    with    a 3791 3790  muﬄer    wrapped    round    his    throat,    crept    quietly    out    of    his    house.    In    Bond    Street    he    found    a    hansom    with    a    good 3792 3791  horse.    He    hailed    it    and    in    a    low    voice    gave    the    driver    an    address. 3793 3792  The    man    shook    his    head.    “It    is    too    far    for    me,”    he    muttered. 3794 3793  “Here    is    a    sovereign    for    you,”    said    Dorian.    “You    shall    have    another    if    you    drive    fast.” 3795 3794  “All    right,    sir,”    answered    the    man,    “you    will    be    there    in    an    hour,”    and    after    his    fare    had    got    in    he    turned    his 3796 3795  horse    round    and    drove    rapidly    towards    the    river. 3797 3796  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                        CHAPTER    XVI. 3798 3797  A    cold    rain    began    to    fall,    and    the    blurred    street-lamps    looked    ghastly    in    the    dripping    mist.    The    public-houses 3799 3798  were    just    closing,    and    dim    men    and    women    were    clustering    in    broken    groups    round    their    doors.    From    some    of 3800 3799  the    bars    came    the    sound    of    horrible    laughter.    In    others,    drunkards    brawled    and    screamed. 3801 3800  Lying    back    in    the    hansom,    with    his    hat    pulled    over    his    forehead,    Dorian    Gray    watched    with    listless    eyes    the 3802 3801  sordid    shame    of    the    great    city,    and    now    and    then    he    repeated    to    himself    the    words    that    Lord    Henry    had    said    to 3803 3802  him    on    the    ﬁrst    day    they    had    met,    “To    cure    the    soul    by    means    of    the    senses,    and    the    senses    by    means    of    the 3804 3803  soul.”    Yes,    that    was    the    secret.    He    had    often    tried    it,    and    would    try    it    again    now.    There    were    opium    dens    where 3805 3804  one    could    buy    oblivion,    dens    of    horror    where    the    memory    of    old    sins    could    be    destroyed    by    the    madness    of    sins 3806 3805  that    were    new. 3807 3806  The    moon    hung    low    in    the    sky    like    a    yellow    skull.    From    time    to    time    a    huge    misshapen    cloud    stretched    a    long 3808 3807  arm    across    and    hid    it.    The    gas-lamps    grew    fewer,    and    the    streets    more    narrow    and    gloomy.    Once    the    man    lost 3809 3808  his    way    and    had    to    drive    back    half    a    mile.    A    steam    rose    from    the    horse    as    it    splashed    up    the    puddles.    The 3810 3809  sidewindows    of    the    hansom    were    clogged    with    a    grey-flannel    mist. 3811 3810  “To    cure    the    soul    by    means    of    the    senses,    and    the    senses    by    means    of    the    soul!”    How    the    words    rang    in    his 3812 3811  ears!    His    soul,    certainly,    was    sick    to    death.    Was    it    true    that    the    senses    could    cure    it?    Innocent    blood    had    been 3813 3812  spilled.    What    could    atone    for    that?    Ah!    for    that    there    was    no    atonement;    but    though    forgiveness    was    impossible, 3814 3813  forgetfulness    was    possible    still,    and    he    was    determined    to    forget,    to    stamp    the    thing    out,    to    crush    it    as    one    would 3815 3814  crush    the    adder    that    had    stung    one.    Indeed,    what    right    had    Basil    to    have    spoken    to    him    as    he    had    done?    Who 3816 3815  had    made    him    a    judge    over    others?    He    had    said    things    that    were    dreadful,    horrible,    not    to    be    endured. 3817 3816  On    and    on    plodded    the    hansom,    going    slower,    it    seemed    to    him,    at    each    step.    He    thrust    up    the    trap    and    called 3818 3817  to    the    man    to    drive    faster.    The    hideous    hunger    for    opium    began    to    gnaw    at    him.    His    throat    burned    and    his 3819 3818  delicate    hands    twitched    nervously    together.    He    struck    at    the    horse    madly    with    his    stick.    The    driver    laughed    and 3820 3819  whipped    up.    He    laughed    in    answer,    and    the    man    was    silent. 3821 3820  The    way    seemed    interminable,    and    the    streets    like    the    black    web    of    some    sprawling    spider.    The    monotony 3822 3821  became    unbearable,    and    as    the    mist    thickened,    he    felt    afraid. 3823 3822  Then    they    passed    by    lonely    brickﬁelds.    The    fog    was    lighter    here,    and    he    could    see    the    strange,    bottle-shaped 3824 3823  kilns    with    their    orange,    fanlike    tongues    of    ﬁre.    A    dog    barked    as    they    went    by,    and    far    away    in    the    darkness    some 3825 3824  wandering    sea-gull    screamed.    The    horse    stumbled    in    a    rut,    then    swerved    aside    and    broke    into    a    gallop. 3826 3825  After    some    time    they    left    the    clay    road    and    rattled    again    over    rough-paven    streets.    Most    of    the    windows    were 3827 3826  dark,    but    now    and    then    fantastic    shadows    were    silhouetted    against    some    lamplit    blind.    He    watched    them 3828 3827  curiously.    They    moved    like    monstrous    marionettes    and    made    gestures    like    live    things.    He    hated    them.    A    dull 3829 3828  rage    was    in    his    heart.    As    they    turned    a    corner,    a    woman    yelled    something    at    them    from    an    open    door,    and    two 3830 3829  men    ran    after    the    hansom    for    about    a    hundred    yards.    The    driver    beat    at    them    with    his    whip. 3831 3830  It    is    said    that    passion    makes    one    think    in    a    circle.    Certainly    with    hideous    iteration    the    bitten    lips    of    Dorian    Gray 3832 3831  shaped    and    reshaped    those    subtle    words    that    dealt    with    soul    and    sense,    till    he    had    found    in    them    the    full 3833 3832  expression,    as    it    were,    of    his    mood,    and    justiﬁed,    by    intellectual    approval,    passions    that    without    such    justiﬁcation 3834 3833  would    still    have    dominated    his    temper.    From    cell    to    cell    of    his    brain    crept    the    one    thought;    and    the    wild    desire    to 3835 3834  live,    most    terrible    of    all    man’s    appetites,    quickened    into    force    each    trembling    nerve    and    ﬁbre.    Ugliness    that    had 3836 3835  once    been    hateful    to    him    because    it    made    things    real,    became    dear    to    him    now    for    that    very    reason.    Ugliness 3837 3836  was    the    one    reality.    The    coarse    brawl,    the    loathsome    den,    the    crude    violence    of    disordered    life,    the    very 3838 3837  vileness    of    thief    and    outcast,    were    more    vivid,    in    their    intense    actuality    of    impression,    than    all    the    gracious 3839 3838  shapes    of    art,    the    dreamy    shadows    of    song.    They    were    what    he    needed    for    forgetfulness.    In    three    days    he 3840 3839  would    be    free. 3841 3840  Suddenly    the    man    drew    up    with    a    jerk    at    the    top    of    a    dark    lane.    Over    the    low    roofs    and    jagged    chimney-stacks 3842 3841  of    the    houses    rose    the    black    masts    of    ships.    Wreaths    of    white    mist    clung    like    ghostly    sails    to    the    yards. 3843 3842  “Somewhere    about    here,    sir,    ain’t    it?”    he    asked    huskily    through    the    trap. 3844 3843  Dorian    started    and    peered    round.    “This    will    do,”    he    answered,    and    having    got    out    hastily    and    given    the    driver 3845 3844  the    extra    fare    he    had    promised    him,    he    walked    quickly    in    the    direction    of    the    quay.    Here    and    there    a    lantern 3846 3845  gleamed    at    the    stern    of    some    huge    merchantman.    The    light    shook    and    splintered    in    the    puddles.    A    red    glare 3847 3846  came    from    an    outward-bound    steamer    that    was    coaling.    The    slimy    pavement    looked    like    a    wet    mackintosh. 3848 3847  He    hurried    on    towards    the    left,    glancing    back    now    and    then    to    see    if    he    was    being    followed.    In    about    seven    or 3849 3848  eight    minutes    he    reached    a    small    shabby    house    that    was    wedged    in    between    two    gaunt    factories.    In    one    of    the 3850 3849  top-windows    stood    a    lamp.    He    stopped    and    gave    a    peculiar    knock. 3851 3850  After    a    little    time    he    heard    steps    in    the    passage    and    the    chain    being    unhooked.    The    door    opened    quietly,    and 3852 3851  he    went    in    without    saying    a    word    to    the    squat    misshapen    ﬁgure    that    ﬂattened    itself    into    the    shadow    as    he 3853 3852  passed.    At    the    end    of    the    hall    hung    a    tattered    green    curtain    that    swayed    and    shook    in    the    gusty    wind    which    had 3854 3853  followed    him    in    from    the    street.    He    dragged    it    aside    and    entered    a    long    low    room    which    looked    as    if    it    had    once 3855 3854  been    a    third-rate    dancing-saloon.    Shrill    ﬂaring    gas-jets,    dulled    and    distorted    in    the    ﬂy-blown    mirrors    that    faced 3856 3855  them,    were    ranged    round    the    walls.    Greasy    reﬂectors    of    ribbed    tin    backed    them,    making    quivering    disks    of    light. 3857 3856  The    ﬂoor    was    covered    with    ochre-coloured    sawdust,    trampled    here    and    there    into    mud,    and    stained    with    dark 3858 3857  rings    of    spilled    liquor.    Some    Malays    were    crouching    by    a    little    charcoal    stove,    playing    with    bone    counters    and 3859 3858  showing    their    white    teeth    as    they    chattered.    In    one    corner,    with    his    head    buried    in    his    arms,    a    sailor    sprawled 3860 3859  over    a    table,    and    by    the    tawdrily    painted    bar    that    ran    across    one    complete    side    stood    two    haggard    women, 3861 3860  mocking    an    old    man    who    was    brushing    the    sleeves    of    his    coat    with    an    expression    of    disgust.    “He    thinks    he’s    got 3862 3861  red    ants    on    him,”    laughed    one    of    them,    as    Dorian    passed    by.    The    man    looked    at    her    in    terror    and    began    to 3863 3862  whimper. 3864 3863  At    the    end    of    the    room    there    was    a    little    staircase,    leading    to    a    darkened    chamber.    As    Dorian    hurried    up    its 3865 3864  \\x0cthree    rickety    steps,    the    heavy    odour    of    opium    met    him.    He    heaved    a    deep    breath,    and    his    nostrils    quivered    with 3866 3865  pleasure.    When    he    entered,    a    young    man    with    smooth    yellow    hair,    who    was    bending    over    a    lamp    lighting    a    long 3867 3866  thin    pipe,    looked    up    at    him    and    nodded    in    a    hesitating    manner. 3868 3867  “You    here,    Adrian?”    muttered    Dorian. 3869 3868  “Where    else    should    I    be?”    he    answered,    listlessly.    “None    of    the    chaps    will    speak    to    me    now.” 3870 3869  “I    thought    you    had    left    England.” 3871 3870  “Darlington    is    not    going    to    do    anything.    My    brother    paid    the    bill    at    last.    George    doesn’t    speak    to    me    either....    I 3872 3871  don’t    care,”    he    added    with    a    sigh.    “As    long    as    one    has    this    stuﬀ,    one    doesn’t    want    friends.    I    think    I    have    had    too 3873 3872  many    friends.” 3874 3873  Dorian    winced    and    looked    round    at    the    grotesque    things    that    lay    in    such    fantastic    postures    on    the    ragged 3875 3874  mattresses.    The    twisted    limbs,    the    gaping    mouths,    the    staring    lustreless    eyes,    fascinated    him.    He    knew    in    what 3876 3875  strange    heavens    they    were    suﬀering,    and    what    dull    hells    were    teaching    them    the    secret    of    some    new    joy.    They 3877 3876  were    better    oﬀ    than    he    was.    He    was    prisoned    in    thought.    Memory,    like    a    horrible    malady,    was    eating    his    soul 3878 3877  away.    From    time    to    time    he    seemed    to    see    the    eyes    of    Basil    Hallward    looking    at    him.    Yet    he    felt    he    could    not 3879 3878  stay.    The    presence    of    Adrian    Singleton    troubled    him.    He    wanted    to    be    where    no    one    would    know    who    he    was. 3880 3879  He    wanted    to    escape    from    himself. 3881 3880  “I    am    going    on    to    the    other    place,”    he    said    after    a    pause. 3882 3881  “On    the    wharf?” 3883 3882  “Yes.” 3884 3883  “That    mad-cat    is    sure    to    be    there.    They    won’t    have    her    in    this    place    now.” 3885 3884  Dorian    shrugged    his    shoulders.    “I    am    sick    of    women    who    love    one.    Women    who    hate    one    are    much    more 3886 3885  interesting.    Besides,    the    stuff    is    better.” 3887 3886  “Much    the    same.” 3888 3887  “I    like    it    better.    Come    and    have    something    to    drink.    I    must    have    something.” 3889 3888  “I    don’t    want    anything,”    murmured    the    young    man. 3890 3889  “Never    mind.” 3891 3890  Adrian    Singleton    rose    up    wearily    and    followed    Dorian    to    the    bar.    A    half-caste,    in    a    ragged    turban    and    a 3892 3891  shabby    ulster,    grinned    a    hideous    greeting    as    he    thrust    a    bottle    of    brandy    and    two    tumblers    in    front    of    them.    The 3893 3892  women    sidled    up    and    began    to    chatter.    Dorian    turned    his    back    on    them    and    said    something    in    a    low    voice    to 3894 3893  Adrian    Singleton. 3895 3894  A    crooked    smile,    like    a    Malay    crease,    writhed    across    the    face    of    one    of    the    women.    “We    are    very    proud    to- 3896 3895  night,”    she    sneered. 3897 3896  “For    God’s    sake    don’t    talk    to    me,”    cried    Dorian,    stamping    his    foot    on    the    ground.    “What    do    you    want?    Money? 3898 3897  Here    it    is.    Don’t    ever    talk    to    me    again.” 3899 3898  Two    red    sparks    ﬂashed    for    a    moment    in    the    woman’s    sodden    eyes,    then    ﬂickered    out    and    left    them    dull    and 3900 3899  glazed.    She    tossed    her    head    and    raked    the    coins    oﬀ    the    counter    with    greedy    ﬁngers.    Her    companion    watched 3901 3900  her    enviously. 3902 3901  “It’s    no    use,”    sighed    Adrian    Singleton.    “I    don’t    care    to    go    back.    What    does    it    matter?    I    am    quite    happy    here.” 3903 3902  “You    will    write    to    me    if    you    want    anything,    won’t    you?”    said    Dorian,    after    a    pause. 3904 3903  “Perhaps.” 3905 3904  “Good    night,    then.” 3906 3905  “Good    night,”    answered    the    young    man,    passing    up    the    steps    and    wiping    his    parched    mouth    with    a 3907 3906  handkerchief. 3908 3907  Dorian    walked    to    the    door    with    a    look    of    pain    in    his    face.    As    he    drew    the    curtain    aside,    a    hideous    laugh    broke 3909 3908  from    the    painted    lips    of    the    woman    who    had    taken    his    money.    “There    goes    the    devil’s    bargain!”    she    hiccoughed, 3910 3909  in    a    hoarse    voice. 3911 3910  “Curse    you!”    he    answered,    “don’t    call    me    that.” 3912 3911  She    snapped    her    fingers.    “Prince    Charming    is    what    you    like    to    be    called,    ain’t    it?”    she    yelled    after    him. 3913 3912  The    drowsy    sailor    leaped    to    his    feet    as    she    spoke,    and    looked    wildly    round.    The    sound    of    the    shutting    of    the 3914 3913  hall    door    fell    on    his    ear.    He    rushed    out    as    if    in    pursuit. 3915 3914  Dorian    Gray    hurried    along    the    quay    through    the    drizzling    rain.    His    meeting    with    Adrian    Singleton    had 3916 3915  strangely    moved    him,    and    he    wondered    if    the    ruin    of    that    young    life    was    really    to    be    laid    at    his    door,    as    Basil 3917 3916  Hallward    had    said    to    him    with    such    infamy    of    insult.    He    bit    his    lip,    and    for    a    few    seconds    his    eyes    grew    sad.    Yet, 3918 3917  after    all,    what    did    it    matter    to    him?    One’s    days    were    too    brief    to    take    the    burden    of    another’s    errors    on    one’s 3919 3918  shoulders.    Each    man    lived    his    own    life    and    paid    his    own    price    for    living    it.    The    only    pity    was    one    had    to    pay    so 3920 3919  often    for    a    single    fault.    One    had    to    pay    over    and    over    again,    indeed.    In    her    dealings    with    man,    destiny    never 3921 3920  closed    her    accounts. 3922 3921  There    are    moments,    psychologists    tell    us,    when    the    passion    for    sin,    or    for    what    the    world    calls    sin,    so 3923 3922  dominates    a    nature    that    every    ﬁbre    of    the    body,    as    every    cell    of    the    brain,    seems    to    be    instinct    with    fearful 3924 3923  impulses.    Men    and    women    at    such    moments    lose    the    freedom    of    their    will.    They    move    to    their    terrible    end    as 3925 3924  automatons    move.    Choice    is    taken    from    them,    and    conscience    is    either    killed,    or,    if    it    lives    at    all,    lives    but    to    give 3926 3925  rebellion    its    fascination    and    disobedience    its    charm.    For    all    sins,    as    theologians    weary    not    of    reminding    us,    are 3927 3926  sins    of    disobedience.    When    that    high    spirit,    that    morning    star    of    evil,    fell    from    heaven,    it    was    as    a    rebel    that    he 3928 3927  fell. 3929 3928  Callous,    concentrated    on    evil,    with    stained    mind,    and    soul    hungry    for    rebellion,    Dorian    Gray    hastened    on, 3930 3929  quickening    his    step    as    he    went,    but    as    he    darted    aside    into    a    dim    archway,    that    had    served    him    often    as    a    short 3931 3930  cut    to    the    ill-famed    place    where    he    was    going,    he    felt    himself    suddenly    seized    from    behind,    and    before    he    had 3932 3931  \\x0ctime    to    defend    himself,    he    was    thrust    back    against    the    wall,    with    a    brutal    hand    round    his    throat. 3933 3932  He    struggled    madly    for    life,    and    by    a    terrible    effort    wrenched    the    tightening    fingers    away.    In    a    second    he    heard 3934 3933  the    click    of    a    revolver,    and    saw    the    gleam    of    a    polished    barrel,    pointing    straight    at    his    head,    and    the    dusky    form 3935 3934  of    a    short,    thick-set    man    facing    him. 3936 3935  “What    do    you    want?”    he    gasped. 3937 3936  “Keep    quiet,”    said    the    man.    “If    you    stir,    I    shoot    you.” 3938 3937  “You    are    mad.    What    have    I    done    to    you?” 3939 3938  “You    wrecked    the    life    of    Sibyl    Vane,”    was    the    answer,    “and    Sibyl    Vane    was    my    sister.    She    killed    herself.    I 3940 3939  know    it.    Her    death    is    at    your    door.    I    swore    I    would    kill    you    in    return.    For    years    I    have    sought    you.    I    had    no    clue, 3941 3940  no    trace.    The    two    people    who    could    have    described    you    were    dead.    I    knew    nothing    of    you    but    the    pet    name    she 3942 3941  used    to    call    you.    I    heard    it    to-night    by    chance.    Make    your    peace    with    God,    for    to-night    you    are    going    to    die.” 3943 3942  Dorian    Gray    grew    sick    with    fear.    “I    never    knew    her,”    he    stammered.    “I    never    heard    of    her.    You    are    mad.” 3944 3943  “You    had    better    confess    your    sin,    for    as    sure    as    I    am    James    Vane,    you    are    going    to    die.”    There    was    a    horrible 3945 3944  moment.    Dorian    did    not    know    what    to    say    or    do.    “Down    on    your    knees!”    growled    the    man.    “I    give    you    one 3946 3945  minute    to    make    your    peace—no    more.    I    go    on    board    to-night    for    India,    and    I    must    do    my    job    ﬁrst.    One    minute. 3947 3946  That’s    all.” 3948 3947  Dorian’s    arms    fell    to    his    side.    Paralysed    with    terror,    he    did    not    know    what    to    do.    Suddenly    a    wild    hope    ﬂashed 3949 3948  across    his    brain.    “Stop,”    he    cried.    “How    long    ago    is    it    since    your    sister    died?    Quick,    tell    me!” 3950 3949  “Eighteen    years,”    said    the    man.    “Why    do    you    ask    me?    What    do    years    matter?” 3951 3950  “Eighteen    years,”    laughed    Dorian    Gray,    with    a    touch    of    triumph    in    his    voice.    “Eighteen    years!    Set    me    under 3952 3951  the    lamp    and    look    at    my    face!” 3953 3952  James    Vane    hesitated    for    a    moment,    not    understanding    what    was    meant.    Then    he    seized    Dorian    Gray    and 3954 3953  dragged    him    from    the    archway. 3955 3954  Dim    and    wavering    as    was    the    wind-blown    light,    yet    it    served    to    show    him    the    hideous    error,    as    it    seemed,    into 3956 3955  which    he    had    fallen,    for    the    face    of    the    man    he    had    sought    to    kill    had    all    the    bloom    of    boyhood,    all    the    unstained 3957 3956  purity    of    youth.    He    seemed    little    more    than    a    lad    of    twenty    summers,    hardly    older,    if    older    indeed    at    all,    than    his 3958 3957  sister    had    been    when    they    had    parted    so    many    years    ago.    It    was    obvious    that    this    was    not    the    man    who    had 3959 3958  destroyed    her    life. 3960 3959  He    loosened    his    hold    and    reeled    back.    “My    God!    my    God!”    he    cried,    “and    I    would    have    murdered    you!” 3961 3960  Dorian    Gray    drew    a    long    breath.    “You    have    been    on    the    brink    of    committing    a    terrible    crime,    my    man,”    he    said, 3962 3961  looking    at    him    sternly.    “Let    this    be    a    warning    to    you    not    to    take    vengeance    into    your    own    hands.” 3963 3962  “Forgive    me,    sir,”    muttered    James    Vane.    “I    was    deceived.    A    chance    word    I    heard    in    that    damned    den    set    me 3964 3963  on    the    wrong    track.” 3965 3964  “You    had    better    go    home    and    put    that    pistol    away,    or    you    may    get    into    trouble,”    said    Dorian,    turning    on    his 3966 3965  heel    and    going    slowly    down    the    street. 3967 3966  James    Vane    stood    on    the    pavement    in    horror.    He    was    trembling    from    head    to    foot.    After    a    little    while,    a    black 3968 3967  shadow    that    had    been    creeping    along    the    dripping    wall    moved    out    into    the    light    and    came    close    to    him    with 3969 3968  stealthy    footsteps.    He    felt    a    hand    laid    on    his    arm    and    looked    round    with    a    start.    It    was    one    of    the    women    who 3970 3969  had    been    drinking    at    the    bar. 3971 3970  “Why    didn’t    you    kill    him?”    she    hissed    out,    putting    haggard    face    quite    close    to    his.    “I    knew    you    were    following 3972 3971  him    when    you    rushed    out    from    Daly’s.    You    fool!    You    should    have    killed    him.    He    has    lots    of    money,    and    he’s    as 3973 3972  bad    as    bad.” 3974 3973  “He    is    not    the    man    I    am    looking    for,”    he    answered,    “and    I    want    no    man’s    money.    I    want    a    man’s    life.    The    man 3975 3974  whose    life    I    want    must    be    nearly    forty    now.    This    one    is    little    more    than    a    boy.    Thank    God,    I    have    not    got    his 3976 3975  blood    upon    my    hands.” 3977 3976  The    woman    gave    a    bitter    laugh.    “Little    more    than    a    boy!”    she    sneered.    “Why,    man,    it’s    nigh    on    eighteen    years 3978 3977  since    Prince    Charming    made    me    what    I    am.” 3979 3978  “You    lie!”    cried    James    Vane. 3980 3979  She    raised    her    hand    up    to    heaven.    “Before    God    I    am    telling    the    truth,”    she    cried. 3981 3980  “Before    God?” 3982 3981  “Strike    me    dumb    if    it    ain’t    so.    He    is    the    worst    one    that    comes    here.    They    say    he    has    sold    himself    to    the    devil 3983 3982  for    a    pretty    face.    It’s    nigh    on    eighteen    years    since    I    met    him.    He    hasn’t    changed    much    since    then.    I    have, 3984 3983  though,”    she    added,    with    a    sickly    leer. 3985 3984  “You    swear    this?” 3986 3985  “I    swear    it,”    came    in    hoarse    echo    from    her    ﬂat    mouth.    “But    don’t    give    me    away    to    him,”    she    whined;    “I    am 3987 3986  afraid    of    him.    Let    me    have    some    money    for    my    night’s    lodging.” 3988 3987  He    broke    from    her    with    an    oath    and    rushed    to    the    corner    of    the    street,    but    Dorian    Gray    had    disappeared. 3989 3988  When    he    looked    back,    the    woman    had    vanished    also. 3990 3989  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                CHAPTER    XVII. 3991 3990  A    week    later    Dorian    Gray    was    sitting    in    the    conservatory    at    Selby    Royal,    talking    to    the    pretty    Duchess    of 3992 3991  Monmouth,    who    with    her    husband,    a    jaded-looking    man    of    sixty,    was    amongst    his    guests.    It    was    tea-time,    and 3993 3992  the    mellow    light    of    the    huge,    lace-covered    lamp    that    stood    on    the    table    lit    up    the    delicate    china    and    hammered 3994 3993  silver    of    the    service    at    which    the    duchess    was    presiding.    Her    white    hands    were    moving    daintily    among    the    cups, 3995 3994  and    her    full    red    lips    were    smiling    at    something    that    Dorian    had    whispered    to    her.    Lord    Henry    was    lying    back    in    a 3996 3995  silk-draped    wicker    chair,    looking    at    them.    On    a    peach-coloured    divan    sat    Lady    Narborough,    pretending    to    listen 3997 3996  to    the    duke’s    description    of    the    last    Brazilian    beetle    that    he    had    added    to    his    collection.    Three    young    men    in 3998 3997  elaborate    smoking-suits    were    handing    tea-cakes    to    some    of    the    women.    The    house-party    consisted    of    twelve 3999 3998  people,    and    there    were    more    expected    to    arrive    on    the    next    day. 4000 3999  “What    are    you    two    talking    about?”    said    Lord    Henry,    strolling    over    to    the    table    and    putting    his    cup    down.    “I 4001 4000  hope    Dorian    has    told    you    about    my    plan    for    rechristening    everything,    Gladys.    It    is    a    delightful    idea.” 4002 4001  “But    I    don’t    want    to    be    rechristened,    Harry,”    rejoined    the    duchess,    looking    up    at    him    with    her    wonderful    eyes. 4003 4002  “I    am    quite    satisfied    with    my    own    name,    and    I    am    sure    Mr.    Gray    should    be    satisfied    with    his.” 4004 4003  “My    dear    Gladys,    I    would    not    alter    either    name    for    the    world.    They    are    both    perfect.    I    was    thinking    chieﬂy    of 4005 4004  ﬂowers.    Yesterday    I    cut    an    orchid,    for    my    button-hole.    It    was    a    marvellous    spotted    thing,    as    eﬀective    as    the 4006 4005  seven    deadly    sins.    In    a    thoughtless    moment    I    asked    one    of    the    gardeners    what    it    was    called.    He    told    me    it    was    a 4007 4006  ﬁne    specimen    of    Robinsoniana,    or    something    dreadful    of    that    kind.    It    is    a    sad    truth,    but    we    have    lost    the    faculty 4008 4007  of    giving    lovely    names    to    things.    Names    are    everything.    I    never    quarrel    with    actions.    My    one    quarrel    is    with 4009 4008  words.    That    is    the    reason    I    hate    vulgar    realism    in    literature.    The    man    who    could    call    a    spade    a    spade    should    be 4010 4009  compelled    to    use    one.    It    is    the    only    thing    he    is    fit    for.” 4011 4010  “Then    what    should    we    call    you,    Harry?”    she    asked. 4012 4011  “His    name    is    Prince    Paradox,”    said    Dorian. 4013 4012  “I    recognize    him    in    a    flash,”    exclaimed    the    duchess. 4014 4013  “I    won’t    hear    of    it,”    laughed    Lord    Henry,    sinking    into    a    chair.    “From    a    label    there    is    no    escape!    I    refuse    the 4015 4014  title.” 4016 4015  “Royalties    may    not    abdicate,”    fell    as    a    warning    from    pretty    lips. 4017 4016  “You    wish    me    to    defend    my    throne,    then?” 4018 4017  “Yes.” 4019 4018  “I    give    the    truths    of    to-morrow.” 4020 4019  “I    prefer    the    mistakes    of    to-day,”    she    answered. 4021 4020  “You    disarm    me,    Gladys,”    he    cried,    catching    the    wilfulness    of    her    mood. 4022 4021  “Of    your    shield,    Harry,    not    of    your    spear.” 4023 4022  “I    never    tilt    against    beauty,”    he    said,    with    a    wave    of    his    hand. 4024 4023  “That    is    your    error,    Harry,    believe    me.    You    value    beauty    far    too    much.” 4025 4024  “How    can    you    say    that?    I    admit    that    I    think    that    it    is    better    to    be    beautiful    than    to    be    good.    But    on    the    other 4026 4025  hand,    no    one    is    more    ready    than    I    am    to    acknowledge    that    it    is    better    to    be    good    than    to    be    ugly.” 4027 4026  “Ugliness    is    one    of    the    seven    deadly    sins,    then?”    cried    the    duchess.    “What    becomes    of    your    simile    about    the 4028 4027  orchid?” 4029 4028  “Ugliness    is    one    of    the    seven    deadly    virtues,    Gladys.    You,    as    a    good    Tory,    must    not    underrate    them.    Beer, 4030 4029  the    Bible,    and    the    seven    deadly    virtues    have    made    our    England    what    she    is.” 4031 4030  “You    don’t    like    your    country,    then?”    she    asked. 4032 4031  “I    live    in    it.” 4033 4032  “That    you    may    censure    it    the    better.” 4034 4033  “Would    you    have    me    take    the    verdict    of    Europe    on    it?”    he    inquired. 4035 4034  “What    do    they    say    of    us?” 4036 4035  “That    Tartuffe    has    emigrated    to    England    and    opened    a    shop.” 4037 4036  “Is    that    yours,    Harry?” 4038 4037  “I    give    it    to    you.” 4039 4038  “I    could    not    use    it.    It    is    too    true.” 4040 4039  “You    need    not    be    afraid.    Our    countrymen    never    recognize    a    description.” 4041 4040  “They    are    practical.” 4042 4041  “They    are    more    cunning    than    practical.    When    they    make    up    their    ledger,    they    balance    stupidity    by    wealth,    and 4043 4042  vice    by    hypocrisy.” 4044 4043  “Still,    we    have    done    great    things.” 4045 4044  “Great    things    have    been    thrust    on    us,    Gladys.” 4046 4045  “We    have    carried    their    burden.” 4047 4046  “Only    as    far    as    the    Stock    Exchange.” 4048 4047  She    shook    her    head.    “I    believe    in    the    race,”    she    cried. 4049 4048  “It    represents    the    survival    of    the    pushing.” 4050 4049  “It    has    development.” 4051 4050  “Decay    fascinates    me    more.” 4052 4051  “What    of    art?”    she    asked. 4053 4052  \\x0c        “It    is    a    malady.” 4054 4053  “Love?” 4055 4054  “An    illusion.” 4056 4055  “Religion?” 4057 4056  “The    fashionable    substitute    for    belief.” 4058 4057  “You    are    a    sceptic.” 4059 4058  “Never!    Scepticism    is    the    beginning    of    faith.” 4060 4059  “What    are    you?” 4061 4060  “To    define    is    to    limit.” 4062 4061  “Give    me    a    clue.” 4063 4062  “Threads    snap.    You    would    lose    your    way    in    the    labyrinth.” 4064 4063  “You    bewilder    me.    Let    us    talk    of    some    one    else.” 4065 4064  “Our    host    is    a    delightful    topic.    Years    ago    he    was    christened    Prince    Charming.” 4066 4065  “Ah!    don’t    remind    me    of    that,”    cried    Dorian    Gray. 4067 4066  “Our    host    is    rather    horrid    this    evening,”    answered    the    duchess,    colouring.    “I    believe    he    thinks    that    Monmouth 4068 4067  married    me    on    purely    scientific    principles    as    the    best    specimen    he    could    find    of    a    modern    butterfly.” 4069 4068  “Well,    I    hope    he    won’t    stick    pins    into    you,    Duchess,”    laughed    Dorian. 4070 4069  “Oh!    my    maid    does    that    already,    Mr.    Gray,    when    she    is    annoyed    with    me.” 4071 4070  “And    what    does    she    get    annoyed    with    you    about,    Duchess?” 4072 4071  “For    the    most    trivial    things,    Mr.    Gray,    I    assure    you.    Usually    because    I    come    in    at    ten    minutes    to    nine    and    tell 4073 4072  her    that    I    must    be    dressed    by    half-past    eight.” 4074 4073  “How    unreasonable    of    her!    You    should    give    her    warning.” 4075 4074  “I    daren’t,    Mr.    Gray.    Why,    she    invents    hats    for    me.    You    remember    the    one    I    wore    at    Lady    Hilstone’s    garden- 4076 4075  party?    You    don’t,    but    it    is    nice    of    you    to    pretend    that    you    do.    Well,    she    made    it    out    of    nothing.    All    good    hats    are 4077 4076  made    out    of    nothing.” 4078 4077  “Like    all    good    reputations,    Gladys,”    interrupted    Lord    Henry.    “Every    eﬀect    that    one    produces    gives    one    an 4079 4078  enemy.    To    be    popular    one    must    be    a    mediocrity.” 4080 4079  “Not    with    women,”    said    the    duchess,    shaking    her    head;    “and    women    rule    the    world.    I    assure    you    we    can’t    bear 4081 4080  mediocrities.    We    women,    as    some    one    says,    love    with    our    ears,    just    as    you    men    love    with    your    eyes,    if    you    ever 4082 4081  love    at    all.” 4083 4082  “It    seems    to    me    that    we    never    do    anything    else,”    murmured    Dorian. 4084 4083  “Ah!    then,    you    never    really    love,    Mr.    Gray,”    answered    the    duchess    with    mock    sadness. 4085 4084  “My    dear    Gladys!”    cried    Lord    Henry.    “How    can    you    say    that?    Romance    lives    by    repetition,    and    repetition 4086 4085  converts    an    appetite    into    an    art.    Besides,    each    time    that    one    loves    is    the    only    time    one    has    ever    loved. 4087 4086  Diﬀerence    of    object    does    not    alter    singleness    of    passion.    It    merely    intensiﬁes    it.    We    can    have    in    life    but    one 4088 4087  great    experience    at    best,    and    the    secret    of    life    is    to    reproduce    that    experience    as    often    as    possible.” 4089 4088  “Even    when    one    has    been    wounded    by    it,    Harry?”    asked    the    duchess    after    a    pause. 4090 4089  “Especially    when    one    has    been    wounded    by    it,”    answered    Lord    Henry. 4091 4090  The    duchess    turned    and    looked    at    Dorian    Gray    with    a    curious    expression    in    her    eyes.    “What    do    you    say    to 4092 4091  that,    Mr.    Gray?”    she    inquired. 4093 4092  Dorian    hesitated    for    a    moment.    Then    he    threw    his    head    back    and    laughed.    “I    always    agree    with    Harry, 4094 4093  Duchess.” 4095 4094  “Even    when    he    is    wrong?” 4096 4095  “Harry    is    never    wrong,    Duchess.” 4097 4096  “And    does    his    philosophy    make    you    happy?” 4098 4097  “I    have    never    searched    for    happiness.    Who    wants    happiness?    I    have    searched    for    pleasure.” 4099 4098  “And    found    it,    Mr.    Gray?” 4100 4099  “Often.    Too    often.” 4101 4100  The    duchess    sighed.    “I    am    searching    for    peace,”    she    said,    “and    if    I    don’t    go    and    dress,    I    shall    have    none    this 4102 4101  evening.” 4103 4102  “Let    me    get    you    some    orchids,    Duchess,”    cried    Dorian,    starting    to    his    feet    and    walking    down    the    conservatory. 4104 4103  “You    are    ﬂirting    disgracefully    with    him,”    said    Lord    Henry    to    his    cousin.    “You    had    better    take    care.    He    is    very 4105 4104  fascinating.” 4106 4105  “If    he    were    not,    there    would    be    no    battle.” 4107 4106  “Greek    meets    Greek,    then?” 4108 4107  “I    am    on    the    side    of    the    Trojans.    They    fought    for    a    woman.” 4109 4108  “They    were    defeated.” 4110 4109  “There    are    worse    things    than    capture,”    she    answered. 4111 4110  “You    gallop    with    a    loose    rein.” 4112 4111  “Pace    gives    life,”    was    the    riposte. 4113 4112  “I    shall    write    it    in    my    diary    to-night.” 4114 4113  “What?” 4115 4114  “That    a    burnt    child    loves    the    fire.” 4116 4115  \\x0c            “I    am    not    even    singed.    My    wings    are    untouched.” 4117 4116  “You    use    them    for    everything,    except    flight.” 4118 4117  “Courage    has    passed    from    men    to    women.    It    is    a    new    experience    for    us.” 4119 4118  “You    have    a    rival.” 4120 4119  “Who?” 4121 4120  He    laughed.    “Lady    Narborough,”    he    whispered.    “She    perfectly    adores    him.” 4122 4121  “You    fill    me    with    apprehension.    The    appeal    to    antiquity    is    fatal    to    us    who    are    romanticists.” 4123 4122  “Romanticists!    You    have    all    the    methods    of    science.” 4124 4123  “Men    have    educated    us.” 4125 4124  “But    not    explained    you.” 4126 4125  “Describe    us    as    a    sex,”    was    her    challenge. 4127 4126  “Sphinxes    without    secrets.” 4128 4127  She    looked    at    him,    smiling.    “How    long    Mr.    Gray    is!”    she    said.    “Let    us    go    and    help    him.    I    have    not    yet    told    him 4129 4128  the    colour    of    my    frock.” 4130 4129  “Ah!    you    must    suit    your    frock    to    his    flowers,    Gladys.” 4131 4130  “That    would    be    a    premature    surrender.” 4132 4131  “Romantic    art    begins    with    its    climax.” 4133 4132  “I    must    keep    an    opportunity    for    retreat.” 4134 4133  “In    the    Parthian    manner?” 4135 4134  “They    found    safety    in    the    desert.    I    could    not    do    that.” 4136 4135  “Women    are    not    always    allowed    a    choice,”    he    answered,    but    hardly    had    he    ﬁnished    the    sentence    before    from 4137 4136  the    far    end    of    the    conservatory    came    a    stiﬂed    groan,    followed    by    the    dull    sound    of    a    heavy    fall.    Everybody 4138 4137  started    up.    The    duchess    stood    motionless    in    horror.    And    with    fear    in    his    eyes,    Lord    Henry    rushed    through    the 4139 4138  flapping    palms    to    find    Dorian    Gray    lying    face    downwards    on    the    tiled    floor    in    a    deathlike    swoon. 4140 4139  He    was    carried    at    once    into    the    blue    drawing-room    and    laid    upon    one    of    the    sofas.    After    a    short    time,    he    came 4141 4140  to    himself    and    looked    round    with    a    dazed    expression. 4142 4141  “What    has    happened?”    he    asked.    “Oh!    I    remember.    Am    I    safe    here,    Harry?”    He    began    to    tremble. 4143 4142  “My    dear    Dorian,”    answered    Lord    Henry,    “you    merely    fainted.    That    was    all.    You    must    have    overtired    yourself. 4144 4143  You    had    better    not    come    down    to    dinner.    I    will    take    your    place.” 4145 4144  “No,    I    will    come    down,”    he    said,    struggling    to    his    feet.    “I    would    rather    come    down.    I    must    not    be    alone.” 4146 4145  He    went    to    his    room    and    dressed.    There    was    a    wild    recklessness    of    gaiety    in    his    manner    as    he    sat    at    table, 4147 4146  but    now    and    then    a    thrill    of    terror    ran    through    him    when    he    remembered    that,    pressed    against    the    window    of    the 4148 4147  conservatory,    like    a    white    handkerchief,    he    had    seen    the    face    of    James    Vane    watching    him. 4149 4148  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                    CHAPTER    XVIII. 4150 4149  The    next    day    he    did    not    leave    the    house,    and,    indeed,    spent    most    of    the    time    in    his    own    room,    sick    with    a    wild 4151 4150  terror    of    dying,    and    yet    indiﬀerent    to    life    itself.    The    consciousness    of    being    hunted,    snared,    tracked    down,    had 4152 4151  begun    to    dominate    him.    If    the    tapestry    did    but    tremble    in    the    wind,    he    shook.    The    dead    leaves    that    were    blown 4153 4152  against    the    leaded    panes    seemed    to    him    like    his    own    wasted    resolutions    and    wild    regrets.    When    he    closed    his 4154 4153  eyes,    he    saw    again    the    sailor’s    face    peering    through    the    mist-stained    glass,    and    horror    seemed    once    more    to 4155 4154  lay    its    hand    upon    his    heart. 4156 4155  But    perhaps    it    had    been    only    his    fancy    that    had    called    vengeance    out    of    the    night    and    set    the    hideous    shapes 4157 4156  of    punishment    before    him.    Actual    life    was    chaos,    but    there    was    something    terribly    logical    in    the    imagination.    It 4158 4157  was    the    imagination    that    set    remorse    to    dog    the    feet    of    sin.    It    was    the    imagination    that    made    each    crime    bear    its 4159 4158  misshapen    brood.    In    the    common    world    of    fact    the    wicked    were    not    punished,    nor    the    good    rewarded.    Success 4160 4159  was    given    to    the    strong,    failure    thrust    upon    the    weak.    That    was    all.    Besides,    had    any    stranger    been    prowling 4161 4160  round    the    house,    he    would    have    been    seen    by    the    servants    or    the    keepers.    Had    any    foot-marks    been    found    on 4162 4161  the    ﬂower-beds,    the    gardeners    would    have    reported    it.    Yes,    it    had    been    merely    fancy.    Sibyl    Vane’s    brother    had 4163 4162  not    come    back    to    kill    him.    He    had    sailed    away    in    his    ship    to    founder    in    some    winter    sea.    From    him,    at    any    rate, 4164 4163  he    was    safe.    Why,    the    man    did    not    know    who    he    was,    could    not    know    who    he    was.    The    mask    of    youth    had 4165 4164  saved    him. 4166 4165  And    yet    if    it    had    been    merely    an    illusion,    how    terrible    it    was    to    think    that    conscience    could    raise    such    fearful 4167 4166  phantoms,    and    give    them    visible    form,    and    make    them    move    before    one!    What    sort    of    life    would    his    be    if,    day 4168 4167  and    night,    shadows    of    his    crime    were    to    peer    at    him    from    silent    corners,    to    mock    him    from    secret    places,    to 4169 4168  whisper    in    his    ear    as    he    sat    at    the    feast,    to    wake    him    with    icy    ﬁngers    as    he    lay    asleep!    As    the    thought    crept 4170 4169  through    his    brain,    he    grew    pale    with    terror,    and    the    air    seemed    to    him    to    have    become    suddenly    colder.    Oh!    in 4171 4170  what    a    wild    hour    of    madness    he    had    killed    his    friend!    How    ghastly    the    mere    memory    of    the    scene!    He    saw    it    all 4172 4171  again.    Each    hideous    detail    came    back    to    him    with    added    horror.    Out    of    the    black    cave    of    time,    terrible    and 4173 4172  swathed    in    scarlet,    rose    the    image    of    his    sin.    When    Lord    Henry    came    in    at    six    o’clock,    he    found    him    crying    as 4174 4173  one    whose    heart    will    break. 4175 4174  It    was    not    till    the    third    day    that    he    ventured    to    go    out.    There    was    something    in    the    clear,    pine-scented    air    of 4176 4175  that    winter    morning    that    seemed    to    bring    him    back    his    joyousness    and    his    ardour    for    life.    But    it    was    not    merely 4177 4176  the    physical    conditions    of    environment    that    had    caused    the    change.    His    own    nature    had    revolted    against    the 4178 4177  excess    of    anguish    that    had    sought    to    maim    and    mar    the    perfection    of    its    calm.    With    subtle    and    ﬁnely    wrought 4179 4178  temperaments    it    is    always    so.    Their    strong    passions    must    either    bruise    or    bend.    They    either    slay    the    man,    or 4180 4179  themselves    die.    Shallow    sorrows    and    shallow    loves    live    on.    The    loves    and    sorrows    that    are    great    are    destroyed 4181 4180  by    their    own    plenitude.    Besides,    he    had    convinced    himself    that    he    had    been    the    victim    of    a    terror-stricken 4182 4181  imagination,    and    looked    back    now    on    his    fears    with    something    of    pity    and    not    a    little    of    contempt. 4183 4182  After    breakfast,    he    walked    with    the    duchess    for    an    hour    in    the    garden    and    then    drove    across    the    park    to    join 4184 4183  the    shooting-party.    The    crisp    frost    lay    like    salt    upon    the    grass.    The    sky    was    an    inverted    cup    of    blue    metal.    A    thin 4185 4184  film    of    ice    bordered    the    flat,    reed-grown    lake. 4186 4185  At    the    corner    of    the    pine-wood    he    caught    sight    of    Sir    Geoﬀrey    Clouston,    the    duchess’s    brother,    jerking    two 4187 4186  spent    cartridges    out    of    his    gun.    He    jumped    from    the    cart,    and    having    told    the    groom    to    take    the    mare    home, 4188 4187  made    his    way    towards    his    guest    through    the    withered    bracken    and    rough    undergrowth. 4189 4188  “Have    you    had    good    sport,    Geoffrey?”    he    asked. 4190 4189  “Not    very    good,    Dorian.    I    think    most    of    the    birds    have    gone    to    the    open.    I    dare    say    it    will    be    better    after    lunch, 4191 4190  when    we    get    to    new    ground.” 4192 4191  Dorian    strolled    along    by    his    side.    The    keen    aromatic    air,    the    brown    and    red    lights    that    glimmered    in    the    wood, 4193 4192  the    hoarse    cries    of    the    beaters    ringing    out    from    time    to    time,    and    the    sharp    snaps    of    the    guns    that    followed, 4194 4193  fascinated    him    and    ﬁlled    him    with    a    sense    of    delightful    freedom.    He    was    dominated    by    the    carelessness    of 4195 4194  happiness,    by    the    high    indifference    of    joy. 4196 4195  Suddenly    from    a    lumpy    tussock    of    old    grass    some    twenty    yards    in    front    of    them,    with    black-tipped    ears    erect 4197 4196  and    long    hinder    limbs    throwing    it    forward,    started    a    hare.    It    bolted    for    a    thicket    of    alders.    Sir    Geoﬀrey    put    his    gun 4198 4197  to    his    shoulder,    but    there    was    something    in    the    animal’s    grace    of    movement    that    strangely    charmed    Dorian 4199 4198  Gray,    and    he    cried    out    at    once,    “Don’t    shoot    it,    Geoffrey.    Let    it    live.” 4200 4199  “What    nonsense,    Dorian!”    laughed    his    companion,    and    as    the    hare    bounded    into    the    thicket,    he    ﬁred.    There 4201 4200  were    two    cries    heard,    the    cry    of    a    hare    in    pain,    which    is    dreadful,    the    cry    of    a    man    in    agony,    which    is    worse. 4202 4201  “Good    heavens!    I    have    hit    a    beater!”    exclaimed    Sir    Geoﬀrey.    “What    an    ass    the    man    was    to    get    in    front    of    the 4203 4202  guns!    Stop    shooting    there!”    he    called    out    at    the    top    of    his    voice.    “A    man    is    hurt.” 4204 4203  The    head-keeper    came    running    up    with    a    stick    in    his    hand. 4205 4204  “Where,    sir?    Where    is    he?”    he    shouted.    At    the    same    time,    the    firing    ceased    along    the    line. 4206 4205  “Here,”    answered    Sir    Geoﬀrey    angrily,    hurrying    towards    the    thicket.    “Why    on    earth    don’t    you    keep    your    men 4207 4206  back?    Spoiled    my    shooting    for    the    day.” 4208 4207  Dorian    watched    them    as    they    plunged    into    the    alder-clump,    brushing    the    lithe    swinging    branches    aside.    In    a 4209 4208  few    moments    they    emerged,    dragging    a    body    after    them    into    the    sunlight.    He    turned    away    in    horror.    It    seemed 4210 4209  to    him    that    misfortune    followed    wherever    he    went.    He    heard    Sir    Geoffrey    ask    if    the    man    was    really    dead,    and    the 4211 4210  aﬃrmative    answer    of    the    keeper.    The    wood    seemed    to    him    to    have    become    suddenly    alive    with    faces.    There 4212 4211  was    the    trampling    of    myriad    feet    and    the    low    buzz    of    voices.    A    great    copper-breasted    pheasant    came    beating 4213 4212  through    the    boughs    overhead. 4214 4213  After    a    few    moments—that    were    to    him,    in    his    perturbed    state,    like    endless    hours    of    pain—he    felt    a    hand    laid 4215 4214  on    his    shoulder.    He    started    and    looked    round. 4216 4215  “Dorian,”    said    Lord    Henry,    “I    had    better    tell    them    that    the    shooting    is    stopped    for    to-day.    It    would    not    look    well 4217 4216  \\x0cto    go    on.” 4218 4217  “I    wish    it    were    stopped    for    ever,    Harry,”    he    answered    bitterly.    “The    whole    thing    is    hideous    and    cruel.    Is    the 4219 4218  man    ...?” 4220 4219  He    could    not    finish    the    sentence. 4221 4220  “I    am    afraid    so,”    rejoined    Lord    Henry.    “He    got    the    whole    charge    of    shot    in    his    chest.    He    must    have    died    almost 4222 4221  instantaneously.    Come;    let    us    go    home.” 4223 4222  They    walked    side    by    side    in    the    direction    of    the    avenue    for    nearly    ﬁfty    yards    without    speaking.    Then    Dorian 4224 4223  looked    at    Lord    Henry    and    said,    with    a    heavy    sigh,    “It    is    a    bad    omen,    Harry,    a    very    bad    omen.” 4225 4224  “What    is?”    asked    Lord    Henry.    “Oh!    this    accident,    I    suppose.    My    dear    fellow,    it    can’t    be    helped.    It    was    the 4226 4225  man’s    own    fault.    Why    did    he    get    in    front    of    the    guns?    Besides,    it    is    nothing    to    us.    It    is    rather    awkward    for 4227 4226  Geoffrey,    of    course.    It    does    not    do    to    pepper    beaters.    It    makes    people    think    that    one    is    a    wild    shot.    And    Geoffrey 4228 4227  is    not;    he    shoots    very    straight.    But    there    is    no    use    talking    about    the    matter.” 4229 4228  Dorian    shook    his    head.    “It    is    a    bad    omen,    Harry.    I    feel    as    if    something    horrible    were    going    to    happen    to    some 4230 4229  of    us.    To    myself,    perhaps,”    he    added,    passing    his    hand    over    his    eyes,    with    a    gesture    of    pain. 4231 4230  The    elder    man    laughed.    “The    only    horrible    thing    in    the    world    is    ennui,    Dorian.    That    is    the    one    sin    for    which 4232 4231  there    is    no    forgiveness.    But    we    are    not    likely    to    suﬀer    from    it    unless    these    fellows    keep    chattering    about    this 4233 4232  thing    at    dinner.    I    must    tell    them    that    the    subject    is    to    be    tabooed.    As    for    omens,    there    is    no    such    thing    as    an 4234 4233  omen.    Destiny    does    not    send    us    heralds.    She    is    too    wise    or    too    cruel    for    that.    Besides,    what    on    earth    could 4235 4234  happen    to    you,    Dorian?    You    have    everything    in    the    world    that    a    man    can    want.    There    is    no    one    who    would    not 4236 4235  be    delighted    to    change    places    with    you.” 4237 4236  “There    is    no    one    with    whom    I    would    not    change    places,    Harry.    Don’t    laugh    like    that.    I    am    telling    you    the    truth. 4238 4237  The    wretched    peasant    who    has    just    died    is    better    oﬀ    than    I    am.    I    have    no    terror    of    death.    It    is    the    coming    of 4239 4238  death    that    terriﬁes    me.    Its    monstrous    wings    seem    to    wheel    in    the    leaden    air    around    me.    Good    heavens!    don’t 4240 4239  you    see    a    man    moving    behind    the    trees    there,    watching    me,    waiting    for    me?” 4241 4240  Lord    Henry    looked    in    the    direction    in    which    the    trembling    gloved    hand    was    pointing.    “Yes,”    he    said,    smiling,    “I 4242 4241  see    the    gardener    waiting    for    you.    I    suppose    he    wants    to    ask    you    what    ﬂowers    you    wish    to    have    on    the    table    to- 4243 4242  night.    How    absurdly    nervous    you    are,    my    dear    fellow!    You    must    come    and    see    my    doctor,    when    we    get    back    to 4244 4243  town.” 4245 4244  Dorian    heaved    a    sigh    of    relief    as    he    saw    the    gardener    approaching.    The    man    touched    his    hat,    glanced    for    a 4246 4245  moment    at    Lord    Henry    in    a    hesitating    manner,    and    then    produced    a    letter,    which    he    handed    to    his    master.    “Her 4247 4246  Grace    told    me    to    wait    for    an    answer,”    he    murmured. 4248 4247  Dorian    put    the    letter    into    his    pocket.    “Tell    her    Grace    that    I    am    coming    in,”    he    said,    coldly.    The    man    turned 4249 4248  round    and    went    rapidly    in    the    direction    of    the    house. 4250 4249  “How    fond    women    are    of    doing    dangerous    things!”    laughed    Lord    Henry.    “It    is    one    of    the    qualities    in    them    that    I 4251 4250  admire    most.    A    woman    will    flirt    with    anybody    in    the    world    as    long    as    other    people    are    looking    on.” 4252 4251  “How    fond    you    are    of    saying    dangerous    things,    Harry!    In    the    present    instance,    you    are    quite    astray.    I    like    the 4253 4252  duchess    very    much,    but    I    don’t    love    her.” 4254 4253  “And    the    duchess    loves    you    very    much,    but    she    likes    you    less,    so    you    are    excellently    matched.” 4255 4254  “You    are    talking    scandal,    Harry,    and    there    is    never    any    basis    for    scandal.” 4256 4255  “The    basis    of    every    scandal    is    an    immoral    certainty,”    said    Lord    Henry,    lighting    a    cigarette. 4257 4256  “You    would    sacrifice    anybody,    Harry,    for    the    sake    of    an    epigram.” 4258 4257  “The    world    goes    to    the    altar    of    its    own    accord,”    was    the    answer. 4259 4258  “I    wish    I    could    love,”    cried    Dorian    Gray    with    a    deep    note    of    pathos    in    his    voice.    “But    I    seem    to    have    lost    the 4260 4259  passion    and    forgotten    the    desire.    I    am    too    much    concentrated    on    myself.    My    own    personality    has    become    a 4261 4260  burden    to    me.    I    want    to    escape,    to    go    away,    to    forget.    It    was    silly    of    me    to    come    down    here    at    all.    I    think    I    shall 4262 4261  send    a    wire    to    Harvey    to    have    the    yacht    got    ready.    On    a    yacht    one    is    safe.” 4263 4262  “Safe    from    what,    Dorian?    You    are    in    some    trouble.    Why    not    tell    me    what    it    is?    You    know    I    would    help    you.” 4264 4263  “I    can’t    tell    you,    Harry,”    he    answered    sadly.    “And    I    dare    say    it    is    only    a    fancy    of    mine.    This    unfortunate 4265 4264  accident    has    upset    me.    I    have    a    horrible    presentiment    that    something    of    the    kind    may    happen    to    me.” 4266 4265  “What    nonsense!” 4267 4266  “I    hope    it    is,    but    I    can’t    help    feeling    it.    Ah!    here    is    the    duchess,    looking    like    Artemis    in    a    tailor-made    gown.    You 4268 4267  see    we    have    come    back,    Duchess.” 4269 4268  “I    have    heard    all    about    it,    Mr.    Gray,”    she    answered.    “Poor    Geoﬀrey    is    terribly    upset.    And    it    seems    that    you 4270 4269  asked    him    not    to    shoot    the    hare.    How    curious!” 4271 4270  “Yes,    it    was    very    curious.    I    don’t    know    what    made    me    say    it.    Some    whim,    I    suppose.    It    looked    the    loveliest    of 4272 4271  little    live    things.    But    I    am    sorry    they    told    you    about    the    man.    It    is    a    hideous    subject.” 4273 4272  “It    is    an    annoying    subject,”    broke    in    Lord    Henry.    “It    has    no    psychological    value    at    all.    Now    if    Geoffrey    had    done 4274 4273  the    thing    on    purpose,    how    interesting    he    would    be!    I    should    like    to    know    some    one    who    had    committed    a    real 4275 4274  murder.” 4276 4275  “How    horrid    of    you,    Harry!”    cried    the    duchess.    “Isn’t    it,    Mr.    Gray?    Harry,    Mr.    Gray    is    ill    again.    He    is    going    to 4277 4276  faint.” 4278 4277  Dorian    drew    himself    up    with    an    eﬀort    and    smiled.    “It    is    nothing,    Duchess,”    he    murmured;    “my    nerves    are 4279 4278  dreadfully    out    of    order.    That    is    all.    I    am    afraid    I    walked    too    far    this    morning.    I    didn’t    hear    what    Harry    said.    Was    it 4280 4279  very    bad?    You    must    tell    me    some    other    time.    I    think    I    must    go    and    lie    down.    You    will    excuse    me,    won’t    you?” 4281 4280  They    had    reached    the    great    ﬂight    of    steps    that    led    from    the    conservatory    on    to    the    terrace.    As    the    glass    door 4282 4281  closed    behind    Dorian,    Lord    Henry    turned    and    looked    at    the    duchess    with    his    slumberous    eyes.    “Are    you    very 4283 4282  much    in    love    with    him?”    he    asked. 4284 4283  \\x0c        She    did    not    answer    for    some    time,    but    stood    gazing    at    the    landscape.    “I    wish    I    knew,”    she    said    at    last. 4285 4284  He    shook    his    head.    “Knowledge    would    be    fatal.    It    is    the    uncertainty    that    charms    one.    A    mist    makes    things 4286 4285  wonderful.” 4287 4286  “One    may    lose    one’s    way.” 4288 4287  “All    ways    end    at    the    same    point,    my    dear    Gladys.” 4289 4288  “What    is    that?” 4290 4289  “Disillusion.” 4291 4290  “It    was    my    début    in    life,”    she    sighed. 4292 4291  “It    came    to    you    crowned.” 4293 4292  “I    am    tired    of    strawberry    leaves.” 4294 4293  “They    become    you.” 4295 4294  “Only    in    public.” 4296 4295  “You    would    miss    them,”    said    Lord    Henry. 4297 4296  “I    will    not    part    with    a    petal.” 4298 4297  “Monmouth    has    ears.” 4299 4298  “Old    age    is    dull    of    hearing.” 4300 4299  “Has    he    never    been    jealous?” 4301 4300  “I    wish    he    had    been.” 4302 4301  He    glanced    about    as    if    in    search    of    something.    “What    are    you    looking    for?”    she    inquired. 4303 4302  “The    button    from    your    foil,”    he    answered.    “You    have    dropped    it.” 4304 4303  She    laughed.    “I    have    still    the    mask.” 4305 4304  “It    makes    your    eyes    lovelier,”    was    his    reply. 4306 4305  She    laughed    again.    Her    teeth    showed    like    white    seeds    in    a    scarlet    fruit. 4307 4306  Upstairs,    in    his    own    room,    Dorian    Gray    was    lying    on    a    sofa,    with    terror    in    every    tingling    ﬁbre    of    his    body.    Life 4308 4307  had    suddenly    become    too    hideous    a    burden    for    him    to    bear.    The    dreadful    death    of    the    unlucky    beater,    shot    in 4309 4308  the    thicket    like    a    wild    animal,    had    seemed    to    him    to    pre-ﬁgure    death    for    himself    also.    He    had    nearly    swooned    at 4310 4309  what    Lord    Henry    had    said    in    a    chance    mood    of    cynical    jesting. 4311 4310  At    ﬁve    o’clock    he    rang    his    bell    for    his    servant    and    gave    him    orders    to    pack    his    things    for    the    night-express    to 4312 4311  town,    and    to    have    the    brougham    at    the    door    by    eight-thirty.    He    was    determined    not    to    sleep    another    night    at 4313 4312  Selby    Royal.    It    was    an    ill-omened    place.    Death    walked    there    in    the    sunlight.    The    grass    of    the    forest    had    been 4314 4313  spotted    with    blood. 4315 4314  Then    he    wrote    a    note    to    Lord    Henry,    telling    him    that    he    was    going    up    to    town    to    consult    his    doctor    and    asking 4316 4315  him    to    entertain    his    guests    in    his    absence.    As    he    was    putting    it    into    the    envelope,    a    knock    came    to    the    door,    and 4317 4316  his    valet    informed    him    that    the    head-keeper    wished    to    see    him.    He    frowned    and    bit    his    lip.    “Send    him    in,”    he 4318 4317  muttered,    after    some    moments’    hesitation. 4319 4318  As    soon    as    the    man    entered,    Dorian    pulled    his    chequebook    out    of    a    drawer    and    spread    it    out    before    him. 4320 4319  “I    suppose    you    have    come    about    the    unfortunate    accident    of    this    morning,    Thornton?”    he    said,    taking    up    a 4321 4320  pen. 4322 4321  “Yes,    sir,”    answered    the    gamekeeper. 4323 4322  “Was    the    poor    fellow    married?    Had    he    any    people    dependent    on    him?”    asked    Dorian,    looking    bored.    “If    so,    I 4324 4323  should    not    like    them    to    be    left    in    want,    and    will    send    them    any    sum    of    money    you    may    think    necessary.” 4325 4324  “We    don’t    know    who    he    is,    sir.    That    is    what    I    took    the    liberty    of    coming    to    you    about.” 4326 4325  “Don’t    know    who    he    is?”    said    Dorian,    listlessly.    “What    do    you    mean?    Wasn’t    he    one    of    your    men?” 4327 4326  “No,    sir.    Never    saw    him    before.    Seems    like    a    sailor,    sir.” 4328 4327  The    pen    dropped    from    Dorian    Gray’s    hand,    and    he    felt    as    if    his    heart    had    suddenly    stopped    beating.    “A 4329 4328  sailor?”    he    cried    out.    “Did    you    say    a    sailor?” 4330 4329  “Yes,    sir.    He    looks    as    if    he    had    been    a    sort    of    sailor;    tattooed    on    both    arms,    and    that    kind    of    thing.” 4331 4330  “Was    there    anything    found    on    him?”    said    Dorian,    leaning    forward    and    looking    at    the    man    with    startled    eyes. 4332 4331  “Anything    that    would    tell    his    name?” 4333 4332  “Some    money,    sir—not    much,    and    a    six-shooter.    There    was    no    name    of    any    kind.    A    decent-looking    man,    sir, 4334 4333  but    rough-like.    A    sort    of    sailor    we    think.” 4335 4334  Dorian    started    to    his    feet.    A    terrible    hope    ﬂuttered    past    him.    He    clutched    at    it    madly.    “Where    is    the    body?”    he 4336 4335  exclaimed.    “Quick!    I    must    see    it    at    once.” 4337 4336  “It    is    in    an    empty    stable    in    the    Home    Farm,    sir.    The    folk    don’t    like    to    have    that    sort    of    thing    in    their    houses. 4338 4337  They    say    a    corpse    brings    bad    luck.” 4339 4338  “The    Home    Farm!    Go    there    at    once    and    meet    me.    Tell    one    of    the    grooms    to    bring    my    horse    round.    No.    Never 4340 4339  mind.    I’ll    go    to    the    stables    myself.    It    will    save    time.” 4341 4340  In    less    than    a    quarter    of    an    hour,    Dorian    Gray    was    galloping    down    the    long    avenue    as    hard    as    he    could    go. 4342 4341  The    trees    seemed    to    sweep    past    him    in    spectral    procession,    and    wild    shadows    to    ﬂing    themselves    across    his 4343 4342  path.    Once    the    mare    swerved    at    a    white    gate-post    and    nearly    threw    him.    He    lashed    her    across    the    neck    with    his 4344 4343  crop.    She    cleft    the    dusky    air    like    an    arrow.    The    stones    flew    from    her    hoofs. 4345 4344  At    last    he    reached    the    Home    Farm.    Two    men    were    loitering    in    the    yard.    He    leaped    from    the    saddle    and    threw 4346 4345  the    reins    to    one    of    them.    In    the    farthest    stable    a    light    was    glimmering.    Something    seemed    to    tell    him    that    the 4347 4346  body    was    there,    and    he    hurried    to    the    door    and    put    his    hand    upon    the    latch. 4348 4347  There    he    paused    for    a    moment,    feeling    that    he    was    on    the    brink    of    a    discovery    that    would    either    make    or    mar 4349 4348  \\x0chis    life.    Then    he    thrust    the    door    open    and    entered. 4350 4349  On    a    heap    of    sacking    in    the    far    corner    was    lying    the    dead    body    of    a    man    dressed    in    a    coarse    shirt    and    a    pair 4351 4350  of    blue    trousers.    A    spotted    handkerchief    had    been    placed    over    the    face.    A    coarse    candle,    stuck    in    a    bottle, 4352 4351  sputtered    beside    it. 4353 4352  Dorian    Gray    shuddered.    He    felt    that    his    could    not    be    the    hand    to    take    the    handkerchief    away,    and    called    out 4354 4353  to    one    of    the    farm-servants    to    come    to    him. 4355 4354  “Take    that    thing    off    the    face.    I    wish    to    see    it,”    he    said,    clutching    at    the    door-post    for    support. 4356 4355  When    the    farm-servant    had    done    so,    he    stepped    forward.    A    cry    of    joy    broke    from    his    lips.    The    man    who    had 4357 4356  been    shot    in    the    thicket    was    James    Vane. 4358 4357  He    stood    there    for    some    minutes    looking    at    the    dead    body.    As    he    rode    home,    his    eyes    were    full    of    tears,    for 4359 4358  he    knew    he    was    safe. 4360 4359  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                        CHAPTER    XIX. 4361 4360  “There    is    no    use    your    telling    me    that    you    are    going    to    be    good,”    cried    Lord    Henry,    dipping    his    white    ﬁngers 4362 4361  into    a    red    copper    bowl    filled    with    rose-water.    “You    are    quite    perfect.    Pray,    don’t    change.” 4363 4362  Dorian    Gray    shook    his    head.    “No,    Harry,    I    have    done    too    many    dreadful    things    in    my    life.    I    am    not    going    to    do 4364 4363  any    more.    I    began    my    good    actions    yesterday.” 4365 4364  “Where    were    you    yesterday?” 4366 4365  “In    the    country,    Harry.    I    was    staying    at    a    little    inn    by    myself.” 4367 4366  “My    dear    boy,”    said    Lord    Henry,    smiling,    “anybody    can    be    good    in    the    country.    There    are    no    temptations 4368 4367  there.    That    is    the    reason    why    people    who    live    out    of    town    are    so    absolutely    uncivilized.    Civilization    is    not    by    any 4369 4368  means    an    easy    thing    to    attain    to.    There    are    only    two    ways    by    which    man    can    reach    it.    One    is    by    being    cultured, 4370 4369  the    other    by    being    corrupt.    Country    people    have    no    opportunity    of    being    either,    so    they    stagnate.” 4371 4370  “Culture    and    corruption,”    echoed    Dorian.    “I    have    known    something    of    both.    It    seems    terrible    to    me    now    that 4372 4371  they    should    ever    be    found    together.    For    I    have    a    new    ideal,    Harry.    I    am    going    to    alter.    I    think    I    have    altered.” 4373 4372  “You    have    not    yet    told    me    what    your    good    action    was.    Or    did    you    say    you    had    done    more    than    one?”    asked 4374 4373  his    companion    as    he    spilled    into    his    plate    a    little    crimson    pyramid    of    seeded    strawberries    and,    through    a 4375 4374  perforated,    shell-shaped    spoon,    snowed    white    sugar    upon    them. 4376 4375  “I    can    tell    you,    Harry.    It    is    not    a    story    I    could    tell    to    any    one    else.    I    spared    somebody.    It    sounds    vain,    but    you 4377 4376  understand    what    I    mean.    She    was    quite    beautiful    and    wonderfully    like    Sibyl    Vane.    I    think    it    was    that    which    ﬁrst 4378 4377  attracted    me    to    her.    You    remember    Sibyl,    don’t    you?    How    long    ago    that    seems!    Well,    Hetty    was    not    one    of    our 4379 4378  own    class,    of    course.    She    was    simply    a    girl    in    a    village.    But    I    really    loved    her.    I    am    quite    sure    that    I    loved    her. 4380 4379  during    this    wonderful    May    that    we    have    been    having,    I    used    to    run    down    and    see    her    two    or    three    times    a    week. 4381 4380  Yesterday    she    met    me    in    a    little    orchard.    The    apple-blossoms    kept    tumbling    down    on    her    hair,    and    she    was 4382 4381  laughing.    We    were    to    have    gone    away    together    this    morning    at    dawn.    Suddenly    I    determined    to    leave    her    as 4383 4382  flowerlike    as    I    had    found    her.” 4384 4383  “I    should    think    the    novelty    of    the    emotion    must    have    given    you    a    thrill    of    real    pleasure,    Dorian,”    interrupted 4385 4384  Lord    Henry.    “But    I    can    ﬁnish    your    idyll    for    you.    You    gave    her    good    advice    and    broke    her    heart.    That    was    the 4386 4385  beginning    of    your    reformation.” 4387 4386  “Harry,    you    are    horrible!    You    mustn’t    say    these    dreadful    things.    Hetty’s    heart    is    not    broken.    Of    course,    she 4388 4387  cried    and    all    that.    But    there    is    no    disgrace    upon    her.    She    can    live,    like    Perdita,    in    her    garden    of    mint    and 4389 4388  marigold.” 4390 4389  “And    weep    over    a    faithless    Florizel,”    said    Lord    Henry,    laughing,    as    he    leaned    back    in    his    chair.    “My    dear 4391 4390  Dorian,    you    have    the    most    curiously    boyish    moods.    Do    you    think    this    girl    will    ever    be    really    content    now    with    any 4392 4391  one    of    her    own    rank?    I    suppose    she    will    be    married    some    day    to    a    rough    carter    or    a    grinning    ploughman.    Well, 4393 4392  the    fact    of    having    met    you,    and    loved    you,    will    teach    her    to    despise    her    husband,    and    she    will    be    wretched. 4394 4393  From    a    moral    point    of    view,    I    cannot    say    that    I    think    much    of    your    great    renunciation.    Even    as    a    beginning,    it    is 4395 4394  poor.    Besides,    how    do    you    know    that    Hetty    isn’t    ﬂoating    at    the    present    moment    in    some    starlit    mill-pond,    with 4396 4395  lovely    water-lilies    round    her,    like    Ophelia?” 4397 4396  “I    can’t    bear    this,    Harry!    You    mock    at    everything,    and    then    suggest    the    most    serious    tragedies.    I    am    sorry    I 4398 4397  told    you    now.    I    don’t    care    what    you    say    to    me.    I    know    I    was    right    in    acting    as    I    did.    Poor    Hetty!    As    I    rode    past    t 4399 4398  farm    this    morning,    I    saw    her    white    face    at    the    window,    like    a    spray    of    jasmine.    Don’t    let    us    talk    about    it    any    more, 4400 4399  and    don’t    try    to    persuade    me    that    the    ﬁrst    good    action    I    have    done    for    years,    the    ﬁrst    little    bit    of    self-sacriﬁce    I 4401 4400  have    ever    known,    is    really    a    sort    of    sin.    I    want    to    be    better.    I    am    going    to    be    better.    Tell    me    something    about 4402 4401  yourself.    What    is    going    on    in    town?    I    have    not    been    to    the    club    for    days.” 4403 4402  “The    people    are    still    discussing    poor    Basil’s    disappearance.” 4404 4403  “I    should    have    thought    they    had    got    tired    of    that    by    this    time,”    said    Dorian,    pouring    himself    out    some    wine    and 4405 4404  frowning    slightly. 4406 4405  “My    dear    boy,    they    have    only    been    talking    about    it    for    six    weeks,    and    the    British    public    are    really    not    equal    to 4407 4406  the    mental    strain    of    having    more    than    one    topic    every    three    months.    They    have    been    very    fortunate    lately, 4408 4407  however.    They    have    had    my    own    divorce-case    and    Alan    Campbell’s    suicide.    Now    they    have    got    the    mysterious 4409 4408  disappearance    of    an    artist.    Scotland    Yard    still    insists    that    the    man    in    the    grey    ulster    who    left    for    Paris    by    the 4410 4409  midnight    train    on    the    ninth    of    November    was    poor    Basil,    and    the    French    police    declare    that    Basil    never    arrived    in 4411 4410  Paris    at    all.    I    suppose    in    about    a    fortnight    we    shall    be    told    that    he    has    been    seen    in    San    Francisco.    It    is    an    odd 4412 4411  thing,    but    every    one    who    disappears    is    said    to    be    seen    at    San    Francisco.    It    must    be    a    delightful    city,    and 4413 4412  possess    all    the    attractions    of    the    next    world.” 4414 4413  “What    do    you    think    has    happened    to    Basil?”    asked    Dorian,    holding    up    his    Burgundy    against    the    light    and 4415 4414  wondering    how    it    was    that    he    could    discuss    the    matter    so    calmly. 4416 4415  “I    have    not    the    slightest    idea.    If    Basil    chooses    to    hide    himself,    it    is    no    business    of    mine.    If    he    is    dead,    I    don’t 4417 4416  want    to    think    about    him.    Death    is    the    only    thing    that    ever    terrifies    me.    I    hate    it.” 4418 4417  “Why?”    said    the    younger    man    wearily. 4419 4418  “Because,”    said    Lord    Henry,    passing    beneath    his    nostrils    the    gilt    trellis    of    an    open    vinaigrette    box,    “one    can 4420 4419  survive    everything    nowadays    except    that.    Death    and    vulgarity    are    the    only    two    facts    in    the    nineteenth    century 4421 4420  that    one    cannot    explain    away.    Let    us    have    our    coﬀee    in    the    music-room,    Dorian.    You    must    play    Chopin    to    me. 4422 4421  The    man    with    whom    my    wife    ran    away    played    Chopin    exquisitely.    Poor    Victoria!    I    was    very    fond    of    her.    The 4423 4422  house    is    rather    lonely    without    her.    Of    course,    married    life    is    merely    a    habit,    a    bad    habit.    But    then    one    regrets    the 4424 4423  loss    even    of    one’s    worst    habits.    Perhaps    one    regrets    them    the    most.    They    are    such    an    essential    part    of    one’s 4425 4424  personality.” 4426 4425  Dorian    said    nothing,    but    rose    from    the    table,    and    passing    into    the    next    room,    sat    down    to    the    piano    and    let    his 4427 4426  \\x0cﬁngers    stray    across    the    white    and    black    ivory    of    the    keys.    After    the    coﬀee    had    been    brought    in,    he    stopped,    and 4428 4427  looking    over    at    Lord    Henry,    said,    “Harry,    did    it    ever    occur    to    you    that    Basil    was    murdered?” 4429 4428  Lord    Henry    yawned.    “Basil    was    very    popular,    and    always    wore    a    Waterbury    watch.    Why    should    he    have    been 4430 4429  murdered?    He    was    not    clever    enough    to    have    enemies.    Of    course,    he    had    a    wonderful    genius    for    painting.    But    a 4431 4430  man    can    paint    like    Velasquez    and    yet    be    as    dull    as    possible.    Basil    was    really    rather    dull.    He    only    interested    me 4432 4431  once,    and    that    was    when    he    told    me,    years    ago,    that    he    had    a    wild    adoration    for    you    and    that    you    were    the 4433 4432  dominant    motive    of    his    art.” 4434 4433  “I    was    very    fond    of    Basil,”    said    Dorian    with    a    note    of    sadness    in    his    voice.    “But    don’t    people    say    that    he    was 4435 4434  murdered?” 4436 4435  “Oh,    some    of    the    papers    do.    It    does    not    seem    to    me    to    be    at    all    probable.    I    know    there    are    dreadful    places    in 4437 4436  Paris,    but    Basil    was    not    the    sort    of    man    to    have    gone    to    them.    He    had    no    curiosity.    It    was    his    chief    defect.” 4438 4437  “What    would    you    say,    Harry,    if    I    told    you    that    I    had    murdered    Basil?”    said    the    younger    man.    He    watched    him 4439 4438  intently    after    he    had    spoken. 4440 4439  “I    would    say,    my    dear    fellow,    that    you    were    posing    for    a    character    that    doesn’t    suit    you.    All    crime    is    vulgar,    just 4441 4440  as    all    vulgarity    is    crime.    It    is    not    in    you,    Dorian,    to    commit    a    murder.    I    am    sorry    if    I    hurt    your    vanity    by    saying 4442 4441  but    I    assure    you    it    is    true.    Crime    belongs    exclusively    to    the    lower    orders.    I    don’t    blame    them    in    the    smallest 4443 4442  degree.    I    should    fancy    that    crime    was    to    them    what    art    is    to    us,    simply    a    method    of    procuring    extraordinary 4444 4443  sensations.” 4445 4444  “A    method    of    procuring    sensations?    Do    you    think,    then,    that    a    man    who    has    once    committed    a    murder    could 4446 4445  possibly    do    the    same    crime    again?    Don’t    tell    me    that.” 4447 4446  “Oh!    anything    becomes    a    pleasure    if    one    does    it    too    often,”    cried    Lord    Henry,    laughing.    “That    is    one    of    the 4448 4447  most    important    secrets    of    life.    I    should    fancy,    however,    that    murder    is    always    a    mistake.    One    should    never    do 4449 4448  anything    that    one    cannot    talk    about    after    dinner.    But    let    us    pass    from    poor    Basil.    I    wish    I    could    believe    that    he 4450 4449  had    come    to    such    a    really    romantic    end    as    you    suggest,    but    I    can’t.    I    dare    say    he    fell    into    the    Seine    oﬀ    an 4451 4450  omnibus    and    that    the    conductor    hushed    up    the    scandal.    Yes:    I    should    fancy    that    was    his    end.    I    see    him    lying 4452 4451  now    on    his    back    under    those    dull-green    waters,    with    the    heavy    barges    ﬂoating    over    him    and    long    weeds 4453 4452  catching    in    his    hair.    Do    you    know,    I    don’t    think    he    would    have    done    much    more    good    work.    During    the    last    ten 4454 4453  years    his    painting    had    gone    off    very    much.” 4455 4454  Dorian    heaved    a    sigh,    and    Lord    Henry    strolled    across    the    room    and    began    to    stroke    the    head    of    a    curious 4456 4455  Java    parrot,    a    large,    grey-plumaged    bird    with    pink    crest    and    tail,    that    was    balancing    itself    upon    a    bamboo    perch. 4457 4456  As    his    pointed    ﬁngers    touched    it,    it    dropped    the    white    scurf    of    crinkled    lids    over    black,    glasslike    eyes    and    began 4458 4457  to    sway    backwards    and    forwards. 4459 4458  “Yes,”    he    continued,    turning    round    and    taking    his    handkerchief    out    of    his    pocket;    “his    painting    had    quite    gone 4460 4459  off.    It    seemed    to    me    to    have    lost    something.    It    had    lost    an    ideal.    When    you    and    he    ceased    to    be    great    friends,    he 4461 4460  ceased    to    be    a    great    artist.    What    was    it    separated    you?    I    suppose    he    bored    you.    If    so,    he    never    forgave    you.    It’s 4462 4461  a    habit    bores    have.    By    the    way,    what    has    become    of    that    wonderful    portrait    he    did    of    you?    I    don’t    think    I    have 4463 4462  ever    seen    it    since    he    ﬁnished    it.    Oh!    I    remember    your    telling    me    years    ago    that    you    had    sent    it    down    to    Selby, 4464 4463  and    that    it    had    got    mislaid    or    stolen    on    the    way.    You    never    got    it    back?    What    a    pity!    it    was    really    a    masterpiece.    I 4465 4464  remember    I    wanted    to    buy    it.    I    wish    I    had    now.    It    belonged    to    Basil’s    best    period.    Since    then,    his    work    was    that 4466 4465  curious    mixture    of    bad    painting    and    good    intentions    that    always    entitles    a    man    to    be    called    a    representative 4467 4466  British    artist.    Did    you    advertise    for    it?    You    should.” 4468 4467  “I    forget,”    said    Dorian.    “I    suppose    I    did.    But    I    never    really    liked    it.    I    am    sorry    I    sat    for    it.    The    memory    of    the 4469 4468  thing    is    hateful    to    me.    Why    do    you    talk    of    it?    It    used    to    remind    me    of    those    curious    lines    in    some    play—Hamlet,    I 4470 4469  think—how    do    they    run?— 4471 4470  “Like    the    painting    of    a    sorrow, 4472 4471  A    face    without    a    heart.” 4473 4472  Yes:    that    is    what    it    was    like.” 4474 4473  Lord    Henry    laughed.    “If    a    man    treats    life    artistically,    his    brain    is    his    heart,”    he    answered,    sinking    into    an    arm- 4475 4474  chair. 4476 4475  Dorian    Gray    shook    his    head    and    struck    some    soft    chords    on    the    piano.    “‘Like    the    painting    of    a    sorrow,’”    he 4477 4476  repeated,    “‘a    face    without    a    heart.’” 4478 4477  The    elder    man    lay    back    and    looked    at    him    with    half-closed    eyes.    “By    the    way,    Dorian,”    he    said    after    a    pause, 4479 4478  “‘what    does    it    profit    a    man    if    he    gain    the    whole    world    and    lose—how    does    the    quotation    run?—his    own    soul’?” 4480 4479  The    music    jarred,    and    Dorian    Gray    started    and    stared    at    his    friend.    “Why    do    you    ask    me    that,    Harry?” 4481 4480  “My    dear    fellow,”    said    Lord    Henry,    elevating    his    eyebrows    in    surprise,    “I    asked    you    because    I    thought    you 4482 4481  might    be    able    to    give    me    an    answer.    That    is    all.    I    was    going    through    the    park    last    Sunday,    and    close    by    the 4483 4482  Marble    Arch    there    stood    a    little    crowd    of    shabby-looking    people    listening    to    some    vulgar    street-preacher.    As    I 4484 4483  passed    by,    I    heard    the    man    yelling    out    that    question    to    his    audience.    It    struck    me    as    being    rather    dramatic. 4485 4484  London    is    very    rich    in    curious    eﬀects    of    that    kind.    A    wet    Sunday,    an    uncouth    Christian    in    a    mackintosh,    a    ring    of 4486 4485  sickly    white    faces    under    a    broken    roof    of    dripping    umbrellas,    and    a    wonderful    phrase    ﬂung    into    the    air    by    shrill 4487 4486  hysterical    lips—it    was    really    very    good    in    its    way,    quite    a    suggestion.    I    thought    of    telling    the    prophet    that    art    had 4488 4487  a    soul,    but    that    man    had    not.    I    am    afraid,    however,    he    would    not    have    understood    me.” 4489 4488  “Don’t,    Harry.    The    soul    is    a    terrible    reality.    It    can    be    bought,    and    sold,    and    bartered    away.    It    can    be    poisoned, 4490 4489  or    made    perfect.    There    is    a    soul    in    each    one    of    us.    I    know    it.” 4491 4490  “Do    you    feel    quite    sure    of    that,    Dorian?” 4492 4491  “Quite    sure.” 4493 4492  “Ah!    then    it    must    be    an    illusion.    The    things    one    feels    absolutely    certain    about    are    never    true.    That    is    the    fatality 4494 4493  of    faith,    and    the    lesson    of    romance.    How    grave    you    are!    Don’t    be    so    serious.    What    have    you    or    I    to    do    with    the 4495 4494  \\x0csuperstitions    of    our    age?    No:    we    have    given    up    our    belief    in    the    soul.    Play    me    something.    Play    me    a    nocturne, 4496 4495  Dorian,    and,    as    you    play,    tell    me,    in    a    low    voice,    how    you    have    kept    your    youth.    You    must    have    some    secret.    I 4497 4496  am    only    ten    years    older    than    you    are,    and    I    am    wrinkled,    and    worn,    and    yellow.    You    are    really    wonderful, 4498 4497  Dorian.    You    have    never    looked    more    charming    than    you    do    to-night.    You    remind    me    of    the    day    I    saw    you    ﬁrst. 4499 4498  You    were    rather    cheeky,    very    shy,    and    absolutely    extraordinary.    You    have    changed,    of    course,    but    not    in 4500 4499  appearance.    I    wish    you    would    tell    me    your    secret.    To    get    back    my    youth    I    would    do    anything    in    the    world,    except 4501 4500  take    exercise,    get    up    early,    or    be    respectable.    Youth!    There    is    nothing    like    it.    It’s    absurd    to    talk    of    the    ignorance 4502 4501  of    youth.    The    only    people    to    whose    opinions    I    listen    now    with    any    respect    are    people    much    younger    than 4503 4502  myself.    They    seem    in    front    of    me.    Life    has    revealed    to    them    her    latest    wonder.    As    for    the    aged,    I    always 4504 4503  contradict    the    aged.    I    do    it    on    principle.    If    you    ask    them    their    opinion    on    something    that    happened    yesterday, 4505 4504  they    solemnly    give    you    the    opinions    current    in    1820,    when    people    wore    high    stocks,    believed    in    everything,    and 4506 4505  knew    absolutely    nothing.    How    lovely    that    thing    you    are    playing    is!    I    wonder,    did    Chopin    write    it    at    Majorca,    with 4507 4506  the    sea    weeping    round    the    villa    and    the    salt    spray    dashing    against    the    panes?    It    is    marvellously    romantic.    What 4508 4507  a    blessing    it    is    that    there    is    one    art    left    to    us    that    is    not    imitative!    Don’t    stop.    I    want    music    to-night.    It    seems 4509 4508  me    that    you    are    the    young    Apollo    and    that    I    am    Marsyas    listening    to    you.    I    have    sorrows,    Dorian,    of    my    own, 4510 4509  that    even    you    know    nothing    of.    The    tragedy    of    old    age    is    not    that    one    is    old,    but    that    one    is    young.    I    am    amazed 4511 4510  sometimes    at    my    own    sincerity.    Ah,    Dorian,    how    happy    you    are!    What    an    exquisite    life    you    have    had!    You    have 4512 4511  drunk    deeply    of    everything.    You    have    crushed    the    grapes    against    your    palate.    Nothing    has    been    hidden    from 4513 4512  you.    And    it    has    all    been    to    you    no    more    than    the    sound    of    music.    It    has    not    marred    you.    You    are    still    the    same.” 4514 4513  “I    am    not    the    same,    Harry.” 4515 4514  “Yes,    you    are    the    same.    I    wonder    what    the    rest    of    your    life    will    be.    Don’t    spoil    it    by    renunciations.    At    present 4516 4515  you    are    a    perfect    type.    Don’t    make    yourself    incomplete.    You    are    quite    ﬂawless    now.    You    need    not    shake    your 4517 4516  head:    you    know    you    are.    Besides,    Dorian,    don’t    deceive    yourself.    Life    is    not    governed    by    will    or    intention.    Life    is 4518 4517  a    question    of    nerves,    and    ﬁbres,    and    slowly    built-up    cells    in    which    thought    hides    itself    and    passion    has    its 4519 4518  dreams.    You    may    fancy    yourself    safe    and    think    yourself    strong.    But    a    chance    tone    of    colour    in    a    room    or    a 4520 4519  morning    sky,    a    particular    perfume    that    you    had    once    loved    and    that    brings    subtle    memories    with    it,    a    line    from    a 4521 4520  forgotten    poem    that    you    had    come    across    again,    a    cadence    from    a    piece    of    music    that    you    had    ceased    to    play— 4522 4521  I    tell    you,    Dorian,    that    it    is    on    things    like    these    that    our    lives    depend.    Browning    writes    about    that    somewhere;    but 4523 4522  our    own    senses    will    imagine    them    for    us.    There    are    moments    when    the    odour    of    lilas    blanc    passes    suddenly 4524 4523  across    me,    and    I    have    to    live    the    strangest    month    of    my    life    over    again.    I    wish    I    could    change    places    with    you, 4525 4524  Dorian.    The    world    has    cried    out    against    us    both,    but    it    has    always    worshipped    you.    It    always    will    worship    you. 4526 4525  You    are    the    type    of    what    the    age    is    searching    for,    and    what    it    is    afraid    it    has    found.    I    am    so    glad    that    you    have 4527 4526  never    done    anything,    never    carved    a    statue,    or    painted    a    picture,    or    produced    anything    outside    of    yourself!    Life 4528 4527  has    been    your    art.    You    have    set    yourself    to    music.    Your    days    are    your    sonnets.” 4529 4528  Dorian    rose    up    from    the    piano    and    passed    his    hand    through    his    hair.    “Yes,    life    has    been    exquisite,”    he 4530 4529  murmured,    “but    I    am    not    going    to    have    the    same    life,    Harry.    And    you    must    not    say    these    extravagant    things    to 4531 4530  me.    You    don’t    know    everything    about    me.    I    think    that    if    you    did,    even    you    would    turn    from    me.    You    laugh.    Don’t 4532 4531  laugh.” 4533 4532  “Why    have    you    stopped    playing,    Dorian?    Go    back    and    give    me    the    nocturne    over    again.    Look    at    that    great, 4534 4533  honey-coloured    moon    that    hangs    in    the    dusky    air.    She    is    waiting    for    you    to    charm    her,    and    if    you    play    she    will 4535 4534  come    closer    to    the    earth.    You    won’t?    Let    us    go    to    the    club,    then.    It    has    been    a    charming    evening,    and    we    must 4536 4535  end    it    charmingly.    There    is    some    one    at    White’s    who    wants    immensely    to    know    you—young    Lord    Poole, 4537 4536  Bournemouth’s    eldest    son.    He    has    already    copied    your    neckties,    and    has    begged    me    to    introduce    him    to    you. 4538 4537  He    is    quite    delightful    and    rather    reminds    me    of    you.” 4539 4538  “I    hope    not,”    said    Dorian    with    a    sad    look    in    his    eyes.    “But    I    am    tired    to-night,    Harry.    I    shan’t    go    to    the    club.    It 4540 4539  nearly    eleven,    and    I    want    to    go    to    bed    early.” 4541 4540  “Do    stay.    You    have    never    played    so    well    as    to-night.    There    was    something    in    your    touch    that    was    wonderful.    It 4542 4541  had    more    expression    than    I    had    ever    heard    from    it    before.” 4543 4542  “It    is    because    I    am    going    to    be    good,”    he    answered,    smiling.    “I    am    a    little    changed    already.” 4544 4543  “You    cannot    change    to    me,    Dorian,”    said    Lord    Henry.    “You    and    I    will    always    be    friends.” 4545 4544  “Yet    you    poisoned    me    with    a    book    once.    I    should    not    forgive    that.    Harry,    promise    me    that    you    will    never    lend 4546 4545  that    book    to    any    one.    It    does    harm.” 4547 4546  “My    dear    boy,    you    are    really    beginning    to    moralize.    You    will    soon    be    going    about    like    the    converted,    and    the 4548 4547  revivalist,    warning    people    against    all    the    sins    of    which    you    have    grown    tired.    You    are    much    too    delightful    to    do 4549 4548  that.    Besides,    it    is    no    use.    You    and    I    are    what    we    are,    and    will    be    what    we    will    be.    As    for    being    poisoned    by    a 4550 4549  book,    there    is    no    such    thing    as    that.    Art    has    no    inﬂuence    upon    action.    It    annihilates    the    desire    to    act.    It    is 4551 4550  superbly    sterile.    The    books    that    the    world    calls    immoral    are    books    that    show    the    world    its    own    shame.    That    is 4552 4551  all.    But    we    won’t    discuss    literature.    Come    round    to-morrow.    I    am    going    to    ride    at    eleven.    We    might    go    together, 4553 4552  and    I    will    take    you    to    lunch    afterwards    with    Lady    Branksome.    She    is    a    charming    woman,    and    wants    to    consult 4554 4553  you    about    some    tapestries    she    is    thinking    of    buying.    Mind    you    come.    Or    shall    we    lunch    with    our    little    duchess? 4555 4554  She    says    she    never    sees    you    now.    Perhaps    you    are    tired    of    Gladys?    I    thought    you    would    be.    Her    clever    tongue 4556 4555  gets    on    one’s    nerves.    Well,    in    any    case,    be    here    at    eleven.” 4557 4556  “Must    I    really    come,    Harry?” 4558 4557  “Certainly.    The    park    is    quite    lovely    now.    I    don’t    think    there    have    been    such    lilacs    since    the    year    I    met    you.” 4559 4558  “Very    well.    I    shall    be    here    at    eleven,”    said    Dorian.    “Good    night,    Harry.”    As    he    reached    the    door,    he    hesitated 4560 4559  for    a    moment,    as    if    he    had    something    more    to    say.    Then    he    sighed    and    went    out. 4561 4560  \\x0c                                                                                                                                                                                        CHAPTER    XX. 4562 4561  It    was    a    lovely    night,    so    warm    that    he    threw    his    coat    over    his    arm    and    did    not    even    put    his    silk    scarf    round    his 4563 4562  throat.    As    he    strolled    home,    smoking    his    cigarette,    two    young    men    in    evening    dress    passed    him.    He    heard    one 4564 4563  of    them    whisper    to    the    other,    “That    is    Dorian    Gray.”    He    remembered    how    pleased    he    used    to    be    when    he    was 4565 4564  pointed    out,    or    stared    at,    or    talked    about.    He    was    tired    of    hearing    his    own    name    now.    Half    the    charm    of    the    little 4566 4565  village    where    he    had    been    so    often    lately    was    that    no    one    knew    who    he    was.    He    had    often    told    the    girl    whom    he 4567 4566  had    lured    to    love    him    that    he    was    poor,    and    she    had    believed    him.    He    had    told    her    once    that    he    was    wicked, 4568 4567  and    she    had    laughed    at    him    and    answered    that    wicked    people    were    always    very    old    and    very    ugly.    What    a 4569 4568  laugh    she    had!—just    like    a    thrush    singing.    And    how    pretty    she    had    been    in    her    cotton    dresses    and    her    large 4570 4569  hats!    She    knew    nothing,    but    she    had    everything    that    he    had    lost. 4571 4570  When    he    reached    home,    he    found    his    servant    waiting    up    for    him.    He    sent    him    to    bed,    and    threw    himself    down 4572 4571  on    the    sofa    in    the    library,    and    began    to    think    over    some    of    the    things    that    Lord    Henry    had    said    to    him. 4573 4572  Was    it    really    true    that    one    could    never    change?    He    felt    a    wild    longing    for    the    unstained    purity    of    his    boyhood 4574 4573  —his    rose-white    boyhood,    as    Lord    Henry    had    once    called    it.    He    knew    that    he    had    tarnished    himself,    ﬁlled    his 4575 4574  mind    with    corruption    and    given    horror    to    his    fancy;    that    he    had    been    an    evil    inﬂuence    to    others,    and    had 4576 4575  experienced    a    terrible    joy    in    being    so;    and    that    of    the    lives    that    had    crossed    his    own,    it    had    been    the    fairest    and 4577 4576  the    most    full    of    promise    that    he    had    brought    to    shame.    But    was    it    all    irretrievable?    Was    there    no    hope    for    him? 4578 4577  Ah!    in    what    a    monstrous    moment    of    pride    and    passion    he    had    prayed    that    the    portrait    should    bear    the    burden 4579 4578  of    his    days,    and    he    keep    the    unsullied    splendour    of    eternal    youth!    All    his    failure    had    been    due    to    that.    Better    for 4580 4579  him    that    each    sin    of    his    life    had    brought    its    sure    swift    penalty    along    with    it.    There    was    puriﬁcation    in    punishment. 4581 4580  Not    “Forgive    us    our    sins”    but    “Smite    us    for    our    iniquities”    should    be    the    prayer    of    man    to    a    most    just    God. 4582 4581  The    curiously    carved    mirror    that    Lord    Henry    had    given    to    him,    so    many    years    ago    now,    was    standing    on    the 4583 4582  table,    and    the    white-limbed    Cupids    laughed    round    it    as    of    old.    He    took    it    up,    as    he    had    done    on    that    night    of 4584 4583  horror    when    he    had    ﬁrst    noted    the    change    in    the    fatal    picture,    and    with    wild,    tear-dimmed    eyes    looked    into    its 4585 4584  polished    shield.    Once,    some    one    who    had    terribly    loved    him    had    written    to    him    a    mad    letter,    ending    with    these 4586 4585  idolatrous    words:    “The    world    is    changed    because    you    are    made    of    ivory    and    gold.    The    curves    of    your    lips 4587 4586  rewrite    history.”    The    phrases    came    back    to    his    memory,    and    he    repeated    them    over    and    over    to    himself.    Then 4588 4587  he    loathed    his    own    beauty,    and    ﬂinging    the    mirror    on    the    ﬂoor,    crushed    it    into    silver    splinters    beneath    his    heel.    It 4589 4588  was    his    beauty    that    had    ruined    him,    his    beauty    and    the    youth    that    he    had    prayed    for.    But    for    those    two    things, 4590 4589  his    life    might    have    been    free    from    stain.    His    beauty    had    been    to    him    but    a    mask,    his    youth    but    a    mockery.    What 4591 4590  was    youth    at    best?    A    green,    an    unripe    time,    a    time    of    shallow    moods,    and    sickly    thoughts.    Why    had    he    worn    its 4592 4591  livery?    Youth    had    spoiled    him. 4593 4592  It    was    better    not    to    think    of    the    past.    Nothing    could    alter    that.    It    was    of    himself,    and    of    his    own    future,    that    he 4594 4593  had    to    think.    James    Vane    was    hidden    in    a    nameless    grave    in    Selby    churchyard.    Alan    Campbell    had    shot    himself 4595 4594  one    night    in    his    laboratory,    but    had    not    revealed    the    secret    that    he    had    been    forced    to    know.    The    excitement, 4596 4595  such    as    it    was,    over    Basil    Hallward’s    disappearance    would    soon    pass    away.    It    was    already    waning.    He    was 4597 4596  perfectly    safe    there.    Nor,    indeed,    was    it    the    death    of    Basil    Hallward    that    weighed    most    upon    his    mind.    It    was    the 4598 4597  living    death    of    his    own    soul    that    troubled    him.    Basil    had    painted    the    portrait    that    had    marred    his    life.    He    could    not 4599 4598  forgive    him    that.    It    was    the    portrait    that    had    done    everything.    Basil    had    said    things    to    him    that    were    unbearable, 4600 4599  and    that    he    had    yet    borne    with    patience.    The    murder    had    been    simply    the    madness    of    a    moment.    As    for    Alan 4601 4600  Campbell,    his    suicide    had    been    his    own    act.    He    had    chosen    to    do    it.    It    was    nothing    to    him. 4602 4601  A    new    life!    That    was    what    he    wanted.    That    was    what    he    was    waiting    for.    Surely    he    had    begun    it    already.    He 4603 4602  had    spared    one    innocent    thing,    at    any    rate.    He    would    never    again    tempt    innocence.    He    would    be    good. 4604 4603  As    he    thought    of    Hetty    Merton,    he    began    to    wonder    if    the    portrait    in    the    locked    room    had    changed.    Surely    it 4605 4604  was    not    still    so    horrible    as    it    had    been?    Perhaps    if    his    life    became    pure,    he    would    be    able    to    expel    every    sign    of 4606 4605  evil    passion    from    the    face.    Perhaps    the    signs    of    evil    had    already    gone    away.    He    would    go    and    look. 4607 4606  He    took    the    lamp    from    the    table    and    crept    upstairs.    As    he    unbarred    the    door,    a    smile    of    joy    ﬂitted    across    his 4608 4607  strangely    young-looking    face    and    lingered    for    a    moment    about    his    lips.    Yes,    he    would    be    good,    and    the    hideous 4609 4608  thing    that    he    had    hidden    away    would    no    longer    be    a    terror    to    him.    He    felt    as    if    the    load    had    been    lifted    from    him 4610 4609  already. 4611 4610  He    went    in    quietly,    locking    the    door    behind    him,    as    was    his    custom,    and    dragged    the    purple    hanging    from    the 4612 4611  portrait.    A    cry    of    pain    and    indignation    broke    from    him.    He    could    see    no    change,    save    that    in    the    eyes    there    was 4613 4612  a    look    of    cunning    and    in    the    mouth    the    curved    wrinkle    of    the    hypocrite.    The    thing    was    still    loathsome—more 4614 4613  loathsome,    if    possible,    than    before—and    the    scarlet    dew    that    spotted    the    hand    seemed    brighter,    and    more    like 4615 4614  blood    newly    spilled.    Then    he    trembled.    Had    it    been    merely    vanity    that    had    made    him    do    his    one    good    deed?    Or 4616 4615  the    desire    for    a    new    sensation,    as    Lord    Henry    had    hinted,    with    his    mocking    laugh?    Or    that    passion    to    act    a    part 4617 4616  that    sometimes    makes    us    do    things    ﬁner    than    we    are    ourselves?    Or,    perhaps,    all    these?    And    why    was    the    red 4618 4617  stain    larger    than    it    had    been?    It    seemed    to    have    crept    like    a    horrible    disease    over    the    wrinkled    ﬁngers.    There 4619 4618  was    blood    on    the    painted    feet,    as    though    the    thing    had    dripped—blood    even    on    the    hand    that    had    not    held    the 4620 4619  knife.    Confess?    Did    it    mean    that    he    was    to    confess?    To    give    himself    up    and    be    put    to    death?    He    laughed.    He    felt 4621 4620  that    the    idea    was    monstrous.    Besides,    even    if    he    did    confess,    who    would    believe    him?    There    was    no    trace    of 4622 4621  the    murdered    man    anywhere.    Everything    belonging    to    him    had    been    destroyed.    He    himself    had    burned    what 4623 4622  organized    under    the    laws    of    the    state    of    Mississippi    and    granted    tax    exempt    status    by    the    Internal    Revenue 4624 4623  Service.

General    Information    About    Project    Gutenberg™    electronic    works 4651 4650  Professor    Michael    S.    Hart    was    the    originator    of    the    Project    Gutenberg™    concept    of    a    library    of    electronic 4652 4651  works    that    could    be    freely    shared    with    anyone.    For    forty    years,    he    produced    and    distributed    Project 4653 4652  Gutenberg™    eBooks    with    only    a    loose    network    of    volunteer    support. 4654 4653  Project    Gutenberg™    eBooks    are    often    created    from    several    printed    editions,    all    of    which    are    conﬁrmed    as 4655 4654  not    protected    by    copyright    in    the    U.S.    unless    a    copyright    notice    is    included.    Thus,    we    do    not    necessarily 4656 4655  keep    eBooks    in    compliance    with    any    particular    paper    edition. 4657 4656  Most    people    start    at    our    website    which    has    the    main    PG    search    facility:    www.gutenberg.org. 4658 4657  This    website    includes    information    about    Project    Gutenberg™,    including    how    to    make    donations    to    the 4659 4658  Project    Gutenberg    Literary    Archive    Foundation,    how    to    help    produce    our    new    eBooks,    and    how    to 4660 4659  subscribe    to    our    email    newsletter    to    hear    about    new    eBooks.'"
